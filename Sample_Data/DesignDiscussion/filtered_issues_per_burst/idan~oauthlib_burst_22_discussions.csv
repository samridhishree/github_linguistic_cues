In the meantime you could achieve this by passing in a custom token generator, for example

```
from your_validator import the_validator
from oauthlib.common import generate_token
from oauthlib.oauth2 import WebApplicationServer

def keep_refresh_tokens(request, refresh_token=False):
    return request.refresh_token if refresh_token else generate_token()

server = WebApplicationServer(the_validator, token_generator=keep_refresh_tokens)

just realized the above solution does not work for me because I am using Server instead of WebApplicationServer.
I could use BackendApplicationServer and LegacyApplicationServer and decide which one gets to process the request, but is there any reason that Server, the all inclusive one, does not support that param?

2,issue_comment,200,idan,oauthlib,squirly,2013-08-01 21:44:48,"I have started doing this but am running into errors with the current implementation.

The current implementation expects that the library user will redirect the client to an error endpoint URL. This seems like a hack and I would never suggest doing this.

It would make more sense to immediately return a 400 error from the current view. In the current view you have the full exception and will be able to provide a better error. Also, it seems weird to not send anything but a 400 error to the user on a client error sending a 302 before returning an error page is very strange.

3,issue_comment,200,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-08-02 08:46:14,"Thanks for taking the time to sort out all these changes. Much appreciated!

Regarding the redirect. It might not be the purest in REST terms but having a view dedicated to showing the error and redirecting rather than returning directly is hardly weird or a hack. It also makes it very clear in the example what the intended way to handle a FatalError is, i.e. display it to the user and not send the user back to client. That said I think it is perfectly fine to suggest to return an error view directly instead of redirecting, but ultimately it is up to the implementer and this is just an example.

Also, if the client still authenticates with a client_id/client_secret, is the client really public? not confidential? Since if you simple want to auth by looking at params in the body rather than in the Auth header that could easily be done in authenticate_client. Maybe I am missing something,,,

4,issue_comment,207,idan,oauthlib,masci,2013-09-16 14:33:01,"Yep, I could bypass authentication in my own validator at `authenticate_client` method, but at a first glance I found this a bit weird because I thought I shouldn't be arrived at that point (the flow does not require validation after all).

Forwarding the parameter would be ok but I prefer not to have such kind of controls outside the validator (plus it costs me a database query :-).

What about subsituting/integrating the `require_authentication` parameter with a call to something like `is_authentication_required()` method in the validator? Base class could return always true to behave like it does now. The same method could be used in the _Authorization flow_ instead of trying to authenticate with _authenticate_client_ method and falling back to _authenticate_client_id_ and letting third parties to decide what to do when that check fails.

If it makes sense to you I can write a draft

I don't feel strongly about either. The former makes it very obvious what methods are used, the latter is less code and is arguably better for dynamic inspection.
