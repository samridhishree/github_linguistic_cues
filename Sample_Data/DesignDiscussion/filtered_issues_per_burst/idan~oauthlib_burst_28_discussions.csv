That's what's used for [insecure transports](https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/8fcceae9ef2d6e3c0cdf38b12ac71bc538dd6432/oauthlib/oauth2/rfc6749/utils.py#L89), for example, and it's also the approach I took in #268 for relaxing the `token_type` requirement in `parse_token_response`. Is this a knob one wants to configure for the whole application or do we need per-call configuration?

If we proceed with the additional parameter to `parse_token_response` as implemented here then it seems that we should also expose that in the other `client/*_application.py` files.

Second, in single-threaded applications, you can just use `warnings.catch_warnings()` to silence the warning (which I assume is why the Warning exception was chosen in the first place). Third, receiving a different scope from the scope you requested seems like an exceptional situation, and exceptional situations warrant exceptions.

If only `warnings.catch_warnings()` was threadsafe, this whole pull request would be unnecessary. :(

I think having docs for how to keep using PyCrypto would be a good start for sure. Also, this update should make it easier for Windows users to get started using RSA-SHA1 as PyCrypto is fairly cumbersome to install there from what I gather.

Could do, though as you mentioned earlier that would break backward-compatibility.

I don't think a `warnings.warn()` is sufficient. The purpose here is to signal to the application that scope has changed, so the application can respond accordingly (by reasking for the denied permission, or downgrading the experience, or ...). The more I think about it, the more it seems like making this a per-call configuration is better than an envvar. I can easily imagine an application that wants to ignore scope changes in some contexts but not in others. The onus is then on #268 as to why an envvar is appropriate there instead of yet another parameter.

I'm skeptical that this needs to be a per-call configuration: if the application wants to ignore scope changes in some contexts but not others, the application can easily enable this exception (or whatever solution we end up with), and just take action when necessary:

``` python
try:
    parse_token_response(token_response)
except Warning as w:

So if I understand this right the problem is that since raising a Warning interrupts the flow the token is never returned. On top of my head there are a few approaches here
1. Not raising but merely logging/warning. This is awkward to ""catch"".
2. Transporting the token on the warning itself. This assumes no other modification/checking is done and complicates the logical flow.
3. Returning the warning/differing scope/etc a long with the token. Breaks current API.
4. Adding more parameters to the token like (oauthlib_)scope_changed (boolean) and (oauthlib_)old_scope. No change in flow and user would check the token items rather than catching a warning.
5. Similar to 4 but rather create a Token class (extending dict) which could have properties such as scope_changed.
6. Introduce a signalling system. Think this is a bit overkill here but maybe worth it in the long run, will have to look into signals and how they might fit a bit more.

I'm currently leaning towards 5. Thoughts?
