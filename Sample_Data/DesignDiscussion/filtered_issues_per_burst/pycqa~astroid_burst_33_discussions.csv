C extensions cannot be loaded for a reason, which is that it creates a security risk, which is why they have to be exempted with ``--extension-pkg-whitelist``. The problem with `numpy` though stems from the fact that it's relying heavily on dynamic features, such as generating members dynamically, which cannot be inferred correctly by pylint. What we need to do is to introduce proper hints through brain modules for these inner modules where numpy uses those dynamic features.",nan,nan

I will try to make something in brain_numpy.py to handle those dynamic features.",nan,nan

Here's the failing commit to fix #172:
https://travis-ci.org/hugovk/astroid/builds/286902750

And here's the passing commit (except for pylint) before that one:
https://travis-ci.org/hugovk/astroid/builds/286903238

In the short term, I suggest at least removing the test so the CI is useful for new PRs. And then revisit the test to make sure the fix for #172 is working as expected.
