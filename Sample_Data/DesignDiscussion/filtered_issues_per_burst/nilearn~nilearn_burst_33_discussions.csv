It is not as mature as the predictive modeling part. Right now nilearn is
in it's early stage, and we need to make sure that the markert most what

Technically, not a full copy is needed, but I think the engineering costs around generating a fake file (and associated catching of the specific test use-case) are greater than that of chipping the full CSV file into Nilearn.
This statement is true conditionally to the fact that several examples behave that way, otherwise the engineering costs associated with handling the current `nilearn_data/data` directory management are then greater.

Out of curiosity: what happens if you smooth for selection of voxels (to apply the ANOVA) and not from the SVM? What is the corresponding prediction score?

Also, what do the maps and the accuracy look like if you make a compromise and smooth a little less (say by 3mm) and take a bit more voxels?

Regarding smoothing the data only for the ANOVA and not the SVM, It is tricky to run `cross_val_score` on that pipeline because I cannot figure out how to define it with scikit-learn API.

- increased number of features (10,000) ==> drop of the accuracy by ~= 0.01 in both cases.

- 5000 voxels and no smoothing seems not to be far from the optimal setting regarding the accuracy.

In the mean-while, resample the mask and use the resampled mask to insert NaNs in the output image. This last step would be optional, to keep the imputed values in the output image.

Also, of course, we would spit a big nasty warning if there are NaNs, and the imputation option is not turned on.
