The real fix to the problem would be to have numexpr merged into numpy. I
don't think that it will happen, but that would be from the big picture
the solution to these problems that pop up everywhere, and not only in
math_img or in nilearn.

In particular, I was trying to map a mask (91,109,91) onto lower-resolution statistical map (65,77,49) and when I ran the resample_to_img method the transformed mask I obtained as a result was all zeros. It turns out I was using nilearn v0.2.5, which is the version still hanging out on conda-forge (oops!). So I used the guide posted for installing nilearn on Windows (http://nilearn.github.io/introduction.html#installation) to update to version 0.3.1. Now I don't have the problem with an all-zero resampled image, but I still get the warning:

Given the usage that we make of this function, it may not be worth the risk.

> And the data isn't loaded twice, as there is the nibabel caching mechanism.

I have trouble understanding on which behavior of nibabel we can rely or not. nibabel caching is evolving and becoming more and more cusomizable. I would not be surprised that a global option to disable it arise in a near future. Anyway I just thought that avoiding calling the same method twice in a row was good practice.

Scikit-learn implements the Jaccard Index in the specific setting of measuring clustering similarity.

I think it's reasonably high-level and light on numpy code (most of the example is just _getting_ the atlases, which is quite a standard analysis, and computing the jaccard indexes is done in one line).

I really like the idea of comparing two atlases map by map and trying to find a one-to-one correspondence, and I believe a lot of people would be interested in it. However, it seems to me like a significantly different question than just measuring similarity between atlases, shouldn't we leave it to another PR?

If you look at the file `nilearn/plotting/__init__.py`, you'll see that we have some code to use the `agg` backend if no sidplay is available. I guess that somehow this code is not working properly on your machine. Could you:
- tell us how you launch the test suite so that we can reproduce
- try to copy/paste the code in the beginning of init and then check that the backend has been switched to `agg` (using `matplotlib.get_backend()`)
- check that you don't have a maplotlib.rc file in your current dir on anything at python loading (maybe an `ipython_config.py`) that pre-set a different matplotlb backend (because in that case, nilearn cannot reset it).

As a reminder, the code to be run:

``` python
def _set_mpl_backend():
    try:
        # We are doing local imports here to avoid poluting our namespace
        import matplotlib
        import os
        import sys
        # Set the backend to a non-interactive one for unices without X
        if (os.name == 'posix' and 'DISPLAY' not in os.environ
            and not (sys.platform == 'darwin'
                     and matplotlib.get_backend() == 'MacOSX'
                     )):
            matplotlib.use('Agg')
            print('Switching backend to agg')
    except ImportError:
        from .._utils.testing import skip_if_running_nose
        # No need to fail when running tests
        skip_if_running_nose('matplotlib not installed')
        raise
    else:
        from ..version import (_import_module_with_version_check,
                               OPTIONAL_MATPLOTLIB_MIN_VERSION)
        # When matplotlib was successfully imported we need to check
        # that the version is greater that the minimum required one
        _import_module_with_version_check('matplotlib',
                                          OPTIONAL_MATPLOTLIB_MIN_VERSION)

_set_mpl_backend()
print('The backend is', matplotlib.get_backend())

```

I see that the failure is caused by something entirely different, if you have any advice on that that would also be nice.
