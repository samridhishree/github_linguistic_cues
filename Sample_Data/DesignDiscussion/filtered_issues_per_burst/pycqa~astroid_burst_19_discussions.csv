It works only partially, because I had to rebuild the function which got bound for changing the parent to the class which gets bound to when the BoundMethod is created, but I need to do the same for the Arguments node and probably for the components from the body, which quickly gets into a slippery slope of rebuilding ASTs. I'll revisit this when we'll have the zipper, since it's probably going to be easier to make a subpart of the tree to depend on a new parent.

I see what you're doing but not how the pieces are going to fit together.  How finished is this?  I'll offer other comments when I have a better understanding of where you're going.

One early top-level comment: if the object model is part of the lookup mechanism, should it be lookup/ rather than interpreter/?  Are lookup/ and interpreter/ well-enough distinguished to be separate directories?

10,issue_comment,319,pycqa,astroid,PCManticore,2016-02-23 21:08:25,"No, the lookup will be part of the interpreter namespace. We might have in
the future something as interpreter/lookup, but I am not sure if we need to
add it now.
