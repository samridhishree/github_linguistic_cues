In `plot_haxby_space_net` or `plot_haxby_searchlight` ? I found z=-18 is the only slice to show some meaningful results in `plot_haxby_searchlight`.

Hum. But we can't do that: it increases our download, which is a major

Yes, plot_haxby_space_net looks good.

For plot_haxby_searchlight, the problem is that we use a ""process_mask"",

No worries ;)

> I decided to move my analysis over to python

Congratulations! Do not hesitate to give us feedback about any difficulty in github issues, this is really valuable to us.

Now, about your problem. Your issue comes from the fact that you are resampling your atlas on your mask. When masking using an atlas, we believe that the most natural resampling is to resample everything on the data, in your case, haxby. We do that by default because:
- resampling the atlas and the mask is less ""expensive"" than resampling the whole data.
- when resampling the signals, we may lose information in the interpolation. We believe that data is the most important so we try not to modify them without explicit user consent.

You can see that in the documentation of NiftiLabelsMasker. The `resempling_target` parameter can be `data` (this is the default value, mask and labels are resampled on the data), `labels` (mask and data are resampled on the atlas) or None (we expect everything to have the same affine).

We do not offer resampling to mask yet but we can add it. I think that we do not check that resampling does not delete regions, we should maybe do it.

Does that answer your question?
",nan,nan
6,issue_comment,1056,nilearn,nilearn,SRSteinkamp,2016-03-11 12:44:08,"Thanks for you quick reply :) 

I was assuming that the space of the mask is the same as the one of the data (which it is), as the mask is derived from the data. 

The problem persists when I resample labels and mask to the data. I added an example to the notebook where I resampled the mask and the labels to the data. And the results are the same as in my original argument. 

So my question/problem is still the same: 
NiftiLabelsMasker still extracts more non-zero timeseries than I would expect by the mask provided in 'mask_img'.

``` python
if sys.version_info[0] == 3:

You should do the same here:

A better way to solve this issue would be to fix the ""affine"" attribute of the _MNI152Template. The way you can do this is using Python ""properties"", they are functions that are called upon access of an attribute. It is actually done in the _MNI152Template for the 'shape' attribute, so you have to mimic the strategy used for ""shape"".
