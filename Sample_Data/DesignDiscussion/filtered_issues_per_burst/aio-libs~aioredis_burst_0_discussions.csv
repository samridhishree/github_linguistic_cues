2,issue_comment,2,aio-libs,aioredis,asvetlov,2014-05-28 18:57:49,"Sounds good for me, but for you that means extra code and tests.
Do you really want to implement the feature very soon?
I guess to postpone one to the future.
At least you can make translation of hiredis events into aioredis ones and do not implement pure python parser.

",nan,nan
3,issue_comment,3,aio-libs,aioredis,popravich,2014-05-29 09:10:16,"here is two ideas:
1.

``` python
# make a decorator that will register function as a redis command;
# make a wrapper that will (in __getattr__ call) look into registry for command
# handler and return that handler bound to connection
# like this:
def command(fun):
    """"""extract name;
       assert not in registry;
       put (name, fun) pair into registry""""""

class Wrapper:
    def __init__(self, conn):
        self.conn = conn
    def __getattr__(self, name):
        fun = registry[name]  # with KeyError to AttributeError translation ofcourse
        return partial(fun, self.conn)
```

2.

``` python
# make a connection wrapper class that will provide all commands
# (throught mixins)
# without any dynamic lookups in registry ro elsewhere
class Redis(_KeysCommandsMixin, _StringCommandsMixin,...):
    def __init__(self, conn):
        self.conn = conn
# plus a factory to instantiate this wrapper.
```

4,issue_comment,3,aio-libs,aioredis,popravich,2014-05-29 12:22:04,"pros & cons:
**1.**
_pros_:
    \* dynamic handlers registration
    \* a way for registerring custom handlers
_cons_:
    \* very hard to debug

**2.**
_pros_:
    \* simple and clean way for implementing commands
    \* easy to debug calls
_cons_:
    \* no simple way for registering custom handlers/commands
