The reason being that filter_and_mask is a fairly general function that can be used by end users, whereas reference_affine is for internal reasons, and makes no sens outside of the scope in which it is used.

I suggest that a new function, say '_safe_filter_and_mask' should be created, that does the checking and calls filer_and_mask after resetting the 'target_affine'. WDYT?

For me, filter_and_mask is an internal function. If you want to expose it, then creating a wrapper is indeed the way to go to handle the reference_affine case. I don't think that reference_affine could be of any use for end users.

Well, it pops up in so many places that we need to consider it as public
(and besides, it has no leading underscore). In essence, it is the
function form of the NiftiMasker.

Maybe we should document and advertise it. But let's worry about this
later.

The 200 character limitation must concern the case when niimgs are numpy arrays. If niimgs is a filename then I'd like to have the full filename and not a truncated version (path to dataset files can be very long sometimes). I think we should put the number of characters as an option of repr_niimgs and use it only when it's not a numpy array.

OK. However, do you think that we need an extra option? Can't repr_niimgs
figure this out by itself?

Anyhow, I think that I'd like a different PR for that.
