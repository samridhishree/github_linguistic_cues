This is misleading: your atlas cannot be trated by NiftiMapsMasker, it should be fed to NiftiLabelsMasker.

> some return directly a nibable.Niftiimage while others return the file name

When a Nifti1Image is returned, it is probably that some processing of the atlas was required. However, this doesn't matter as both are niimgs and can be processed by all nilearn functions.

> some just return a list while I am returning a dictionary

Well, a list can be seen as an ""int to string"" dictionary :P. I think that we should return dictionaries everywhere.

Yes! We definitely need to harmonize the naming conventions and return types. However, I have no time to do it. Let's merge your PR and then solve the problem of the naming.

Then the parameter would be used also to create the dataset folder with the version attached, nonetheless I think it would be misleading for a user to have the parameter in the function exposed when at the moment there is no download of other versions, so maybe we would also need to point out in the docs that other versions are not downloadable yet?

There is an iterator to iterate on non-first dimensions, it is `np.nested_iters`. However this is not the fastest solution, transposing the axes is even faster. It has to be noted that, for that particular purpose, a `nditer` may be the faster solution because it would iter on both arrays at the same time.

Here is a small bench to convince you.

``` python
import numpy as np
import time


a = np.random.random((20, 30, 40, 5, 6))

t0 = time.time()
for i in range(100):
    all_img = (slice(None), ) * 3
    other_shape = a.shape[3:]
    for ind in np.ndindex(*other_shape):
        a[all_img + ind].shape
print time.time() - t0

t0 = time.time()
for i in range(100):
    it0, it1 = np.nested_iters(a, [range(3, a.ndim), [0, 1, 2]], flags=['multi_index'])
    for x in it0:
        it1.itviews[0].shape
print time.time() - t0

t0 = time.time()
for i in range(100):
    other_shape = a.shape[3:]
    b = np.transpose(a, range(3, a.ndim) + [0, 1, 2])
    b = np.reshape(b, (-1,) + a.shape[:3])
    for x in b:
        x
print time.time() - t0
