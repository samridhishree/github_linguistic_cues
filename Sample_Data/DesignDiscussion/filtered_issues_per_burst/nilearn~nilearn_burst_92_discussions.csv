Good point. Plots looks surprising. It is not failing with error but fails drastically in finding correct levels leading to masking out entire background.

> We recently migrated to a new AWS account.  As part of this migration, the data from the 'fcp-indi' bucket was synced to a temporary bucket ('fcp-indi-new') belonging to our new account.  After the migration of our data to the new account, our old account was deleted, and along with it the old 'fcp-indi' bucket.  In order to preserve the S3 paths that we had been using under the old account, we re-created the 'fcp-indi' bucket under our new account and began syncing all of the data in 'fcp-indi-new' to it.  At this time, I changed the URLs in our documentation to ensure that interested researchers could still access our data from the temporary bucket while it was syncing to the new 'fcp-indi' bucket.  Presently, the file sync is finished and the only reason that the temporary bucket ('fcp-indi-new') is still referred to in the documentation is that we also had to change permissions for all the files in 'fcp-indi' using a script so that they were publicly readable.  This script has finished executing, however, and I am reverting the documentation to refer to the 'fcp-indi' bucket now.

> So to answer your question, the data is the same in 'fcp-indi-new' and 'fcp-indi', but you shouldn't need to change your code.  In fact, you should use 'fcp-indi', since we are going to remove the 'fcp-indi-new' bucket now that our migration is finished.

Overall, this kind of functionality, not strictly neuroimaging related, lives more in scikit-learn than nilearn.

What may be useful could be to add a function to do matching of 2 sets of maps, using sklearn.utils.linear_assignment. It should also be added to a nilearn example, for instance at the end of http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_compare_resting_state_decomposition.html, to plot the same map for both ICA and dict-learning.

Scikit-learn implements the Jaccard Index in the specific setting of measuring clustering similarity. Here we have a fuzzy extension of the measure that will probably not be accepted in sklearn because there is no ""best"" way to make this extension. In particular, people in neuroimaging tend to use extensions that do not rely on linear assignment of the regions, see _Generalized Overlap Measures for Evaluation and
