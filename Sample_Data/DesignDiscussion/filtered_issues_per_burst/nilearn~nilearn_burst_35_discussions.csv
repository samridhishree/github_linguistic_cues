I heard Gael saying that scikit-learn's API for linear models was not optimal. Would it be improved to take 1 and 2 into account, I would be glad to simplify the current tests.
That said, I am aware we should not modify a general library such as scikit-learn to address the need of a more specific one (here nilearn). But, if it turns out that the use case involving 1 and 2 is more and more encountered, maybe it would be worth to have a discussion about it to be considered in scikit-learn.

This is really a nilearn question, not a scikit-learn question. Contrasts
have no meaning in scikit-learn. We are going to have to come up with our
own API here.

I do find that line 200 of permuted_least_squares is not tested and to check this, you can replace it by something that raises an exception. The tests run fine. I really think that I'd like this to be tested, as I am worried that a fairly important behavior goes untested.

Feel free to merge. I made a comment about a warning. If you have an idea on how to improve it, it would be great. But elsewhere just merge without worrying about it.

You don't need an extra review, merge when you are ready.

However, the current state of this example is that it is too technical
for anybody that is not an expert. I am afraid that there isn't much that
we can do about, but it is certainly not something that we can show

We'll have to do this, but later, because it means have subdirectories.
Right now the examples are in the root folder, because when people
download the package it runs out of the box without installation.

When we close in on an alpha release (this summer?), we will do that.
