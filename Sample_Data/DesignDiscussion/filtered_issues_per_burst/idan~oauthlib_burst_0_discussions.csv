Added support for extracting query parameters as per 3.4.1.3.1.
The parameters does not have to be unique, thus I have modified for use of a list of tuples instead of a dictionary
The parameters were escaped one time to much, removed.
Both client and access secret can be empty, not only access. Per 3.4.2.
Added a few tests based on the RFC and http://hueniverse.com/oauth/guide/authentication/
