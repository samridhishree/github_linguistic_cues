An example extracting ROIs from a statistical map (@KamalakerDadi has a
great one almost ready), examples about computing masks (we have a few),
the resampling example. Maybe more later, as we are finding that it is
very important to teach people to do efficient yet simple manipulations

I have another suggestion (not for your PR, in general). In nilearn, we often use weird coding patterns (I'm thinking of taking the sum of a numpy array to know if there is nan inside for example). It would be interesting to keep a performance test (time and memory usage) for some of these patterns.

It is useful for other developers and, for example, we could bench the Nifti1Image format, on which we rely heavily, and thus spot if there is performance regression.

Benching the I/O is also interesting for cluster computation: some design patterns may not be favorable on a cluster because of longer file access time.

This is not a trivial work. What do you think?

For computation time testing, it's difficult because it depends on the speed of the cpu running the test. Using reference measures computed from the current master and stored in a dedicated file, we could compare the measures of a PR against them and raise an error in case of a too large difference.

I see the point. I don't how one can check the underlying I/O system calls from Python.
Maybe this could be done using a call to an external command like (only available on posix):

``` bash
# Return the number of system calls to read
strace python -c ""some python code with I/O"" 2>&1 | grep read | wc -l
# Return the number of system calls to write
strace python -c ""some python code with I/O"" 2>&1 | grep write | wc -l
```

The output of the commands above could then be sent back to and analyzed be the global python test script.

> This is not a trivial work.

scikit-learn tried to do these kind of performance monitoring at one point during a GSoC. From what I have heard, a significant amount of time was invested with little return because this is a lot of work to maintain the infrastructure to do it. From what I remember it was based on vbench which ended up changing its internals and breaking the work that was done on scikit-learn.

We should look at that. But nilearn is probably not the place to set this

I should work on my impression of converging then :-). Given the %memit behaviour we saw, I would feel a lot more confident to check that the memory usage is not smaller than 10 MiB. You may need to change your test to make sure that the function uses some memory for example by creating the array inside the function if you want to make sure that something doesn't make any copy, e.g. in your test_iter_niimg stuff but that sounds fine to me.

The actual policy in nilearn is to name it `load_atlas`. `load` because it is not downloaded and `atlas` because we do not differentiate atlases from coordinates ATM. I suggest that you set this name and we open an issue to discuss atlas vs. coords.

I think that the best way to compute correlations with LedoitWolf is to standardize the time series first. The reasoning being that LedoitWolf strives to give the best estimate (minimize a risk) of the covariance matrix. If what we want are correlations, we want the best estimate of the covariance of the standardized data.

By the way, such a difference will be also present with something like a GraphLasso for the estimator.

Hence, I would add in the ConnectivityMeasure transformer a test that normalizes time-series before running the covariance estimator if kind==""correlations"".

It's not an implementation detail: it's about whether it will download

Not entirely convinced the user cares that much about these details, he just wants to get the data and  vast majority of cases has the resources (internet + disk space) to do so.

For the record that was meant as a tongue in cheek comment. IIRC most datasets in nilearn need to be downloaded the first time. The poor modern neuroscience hacker without an internet connection is slightly out of luck I am afraid, unless of course he has downloaded the dataset already.

Other than that I reckon we are getting a bit side-tracked with respect to the original issue.

Regarding atlas vs. coords: I prefer to keep atlas since I've never read Power coordinates anywhere. But I have no strong feelings, I am OK for changing it to coords if majority votes for it.

Regarding fetch vs load: I am not against the distinction between online/offline but what bothers me is that this comes before the fact that the dataset is an atlas. First, I think that the difference between `fetch` and `load` is not clear for everybody (let's ask Baptiste if he knows the difference...). A better option would be to put in the name but further. Something like `fetch_atlas_blabla_offline`. We can even make it closer like `fetch_atlas_offline_blabla` but putting it in first position will lose people that are used to do `fetch_atlas_<TAB>` like Loic said.

A few comments:
- the issue was talking about moving around the examples but you moved also some of the documentation, e.g. plotting.rst got moved from doc/manipulating_visualizing to doc/plotting manipulating_images.rst got moved from doc/manipulating_visualizing to manipulating_images. Not sure whether the generated HTML looks any different. If it doesn't that's probably fine.
- Someone should double-check once CircleCI that the breakdown of the examples by category makes sense. In particular what went into the ""Advanced"" section. Here is a comment from @GaelVaroquaux from the associated issue in case it helps:

> Advanced is just another word for 'other', in a certain sense. We would put things like the low-level ICA stuff, or the mass-univariate stuff. Ie things that we don't really want to advertise strong to end users.

It would be fantastic if you would contact them. We can put a note in the
documentation stipulating the conditions of use. We cannot put something
where there is an action from the user, as things need to be able to run
without user intervention, eg on clusters.

I have a warning when running my example: `SparseEfficiencyWarning: Changing the sparsity structure of a csr_matrix is expensive. lil_matrix is more efficient. `

I do it. However, a masked seed is not a showstopper for me: the rest of the sphere can contain unmasked voxels.

Any change on CSS needs to be validated thoroughly, as it affects the
whole documentation. These things are tricky.

Backporting some CSS from scipy-lectures to nilearn would probably fix
this, as a lot of effort went into designing a very good CSS for the code
block in scipy-lectures. But this is a certain amount of work.

More than skip tests, you cannot import it at all windows, I suspect.

This is a possibility but I would be surprised as the maximum memory is set to 10000000 (10MB) and the size of the array is 12MB which is not that much.

But we don't use older versions of Python. This is why this seems strange to me.

- you have 2 `for` loops: one to fetch the files, one to load them. They can be merged.
- you have 3 for loops intricated for the 3 parameters. You can factorize that using itertools
- you generate a string for each item of the dataset. That mean that, if I want to have the matrices of dimensionality 20, I'll have to parse your string, which is inconvenient, you can use 3 lists instead.
- there is no reason to call `_fetch_files` several times since you only download one file

So I would write:

``` python
    dataset_name = 'Megatrawls'
    data_dir = _get_dataset_dir(dataset_name, data_dir=data_dir, verbose=verbose)
    description = _get_dataset_descr(dataset_name)

    mat_map = dict(correlation='Znet1.txt', partial_correlation='Znet2.txt')

    # Fetch all files
    files = _fetch_files(data_dir, files, resume=resume, verbose=verbose)

    # Load them
    files = [csv_to_array(f) for f in files]

    # Build the output bunch
    return Bunch(
        description=description,
        dimensionality=dims,
        timeseries=tseries,
        matrices=mats,
        data=files)

A good thing can also be to replace the `data` element by `correlation` and `partial_correlation` or both when pertinent.

    dummy.write(""<?xml version='1.0' encoding='us-ascii'?> ""

The problem is that your dummy file must be loadable by `csv_to_array` and empty files are not. You can, for exemple, replace the call of `csv_to_array` by `np.gen_from_txt` directly. You can also determine the filepaths that will be loaded by the function and make them non empty:

    for dim in [25, 100, 200, 300]:

Why splitting everything between `correlation` and `partial_correlation` and not having three lists in the bunch: `dimensionality`, `timeseries` and `matrices`? I am still convinced that allowing only one value per parameter would be much simpler: this is what we already do for most of the fetchers (for harvard oxford, only one type of atlas is allowed, for aal, it's the same, only one version at a time).
