That is, there were niftis in different shapes as well as data in different representations (3D/4D), since everybody simply sent there data in the form they have the habit of processing it at their respective labs.

In this particular case, it would have been nice to rapidly get an overview of all the heterogeneous data by first getting everything into one 4D image in the same space to begin with.
More generally, I see the gain of concat_img in being able to collect niftis from heterogeneous origins/data processing cultures, including NeuroVault- or OpenfMRI-like sources.

The greater than will also work with ints. I have no preference.

I would say this is the wrong way around: _utils should be used by user-facing modules otherwise you'll increase your risk creating circular depencies. Maybe the simplest is to add the functionality to _utils and then just do `from _utils import concat_img` in image.py so that it is exposed to the user.

I think so and if we want a user-facing concat_img we just import it in nilearn.image something like:
`from .._utils import concat_img` this way it will be accessible as `nilearn.image.concat_img`

OK then I suggest:
- To submit a bug to the scipy tracker (with the script attached)
- To cast our data to the right endianess

This issue has not been resolved yet because the problem is not in adding shelving support in MultiNiftiMasker. This is the easy part. The question is: how do we handle shelved data in the rest of the library? What if a user wants to use a scikit-learn algorithm on shelved data? We have no answer for these questions. I think this should be discussed with the whole nilearn team.

I added this to the original issue, which seems more like the right place to me.

Sure, my bad. Please ignore my previous comment.

Let's not worry with this.
