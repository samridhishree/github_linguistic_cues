using keys prefixed with specific hash tags and sending FLUSHALL only when needed.

I changed keys to something like {key:delete}:1 whenever multiple keys are used on the same node. The remaining tests are skipped because the tested functionality is not meaningful on a cluster or has not yet been implemented by the cluster code.

You can find my pull request to trezorg's fork here: https://github.com/trezorg/aioredis/pull/1

To reduce the risk of merge conflicts while the cluster code is still in development I could create a pull request to your repository which would only include my changes to the *_commands_test.py files (and a bit in _testutils.py), but no actual cluster code. Do you think this is a good idea?

Besides, I still think that it would be better to flush the database before each test. It would make the tests independent and would allow to remove many delete-commands at the beginning of various tests.
