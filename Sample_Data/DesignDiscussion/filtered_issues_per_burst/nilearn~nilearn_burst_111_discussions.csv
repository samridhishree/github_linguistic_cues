In case of a 4D image, ndimage is going to take the large CC in all
direction, ie in the 4D space. That is most likely going to surprise the
user. I think that, if the input image is 4D, we want to either raise an
error, or loop on every 3D image.

",nan,nan

The reason is that we tried this previously and the codebase has grown to handle 3d/4d cases, and also users ended up feeding 4d images to some functions, thinking it was 3d, which resulted in unexpected results.

I think that we should add for 3d first, and discuss in a separate issue how to make it easy for users to process 4d images (and possibly do it for other functions as well).",nan,nan

It's my feeling too. The functionality is one that I would expect on 3D,

For me (being more of a user): In my feeling no added functionality is needed as iter_image & concat_img should do the job already. But maybe adding an explicit example could do the trick, to stress the usefulness of those function (also new_img_like etc.). However: different issue. ",nan,nan

There are few things need to be done before merge.

- ```threshold=threshold``` is missed specifying in ```_plot_img_with_bg```. By specifying that, user can now pass their threshold to rois, if needed.
- In the ```plot_roi``` docstring at parameter ```threshold```. You should add ```default=0.5```.
- Add a Notes section above See Also. In Notes, adding a single line saying that ""A very small threshold is applied by default to eliminate numerical noise from the images background. Otherwise, images will be plotted with background noise.""

See issue #443 for more discussion on this. Somehow that issue got closed without addressing.

@KamalakerDadi may be I was unclear. So first my mouse fMRI images have different range than human images, e.g.` print func_imgs[0].header.get_zooms()` gives `(0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 1.0)`. Now I am using DictionaryLearning to extract my networks, with a smoothing FWHM suitable for my data
```Python
from nilearn.decomposition import DictLearning

dict_learn = DictLearning(n_components=20, smoothing_fwhm=.3, n_jobs=-3)
dict_learn.fit(func_imgs)
components_img = dict_learn.masker_.inverse_transform(dict_learn.components_)
```
At this point everything works fine. Now I want to keep only large enough regions
```Python
extractor = RegionExtractor(components_img, thresholding_strategy='ratio_n_voxels',
    extractor='local_regions', min_region_size=.4)
extractor.fit()
```
and here I have an error
```Python
ValueError: zero-size array to reduction operation maximum which has no identity
```

However when I set `smoothing_fwhm=.3` here
```Python
https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/regions/region_extractor.py#L401
```
I get my regions extracted.",nan,nan
