11,pull_request_commit_comment,28,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2012-11-11 21:39:16,"I added the resume feature because I had huge problems downloadiing the ADHD dataset. Problem is that the resume feature has not been fully tested for the moment and may lead to unexpected results so I have chosen to keep it disabled for the moment. Plus, if we decide to enable it by default later, I think that this won't disturb the user.

- I don't like the name 'compute_session_epi_mask'. I know that it is what is used in nipy, but I don't like it
- I don't like the name 'regressor' in the datasets, do designate confound regressors. I think that I'd rather have them be called 'confounds'.
