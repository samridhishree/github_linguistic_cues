First, the mechanism used to turn off globbing should also turn this off.

Second, in terms of avoiding user error, I think that one think that we could do is that if len(os.path.split(dirname)) > 1, we should check if the base directory exists. If it doesn't exist, we should bail out, and give a very explicit error message. That error message should check if the path has been expanded, and if so explain what has happened to the user, and how to avoid this (for instance with '~""). That way, if a user gets path expansion by mistake, he/she understand what is going on.

I disagree: what if a user (ie windows user) has a '~' in a directory
name. That user will be very very surprised, and will not understand
what's going on.

> 1. to also use os.path.expanduser in joblib.Memory

There is no globbing/expansion logic in joblib. I don't want to add any.
It's not the feeling of the library.

Reading the [doc](https://docs.python.org/2/library/os.path.html#os.path.expanduser), only initial `~` is taken in to account. On windows, `~` might be used by the system at the end of long paths. It will be fine.
If the user created a directory starting with `~`, to me this is because he is looking for troubles, this is a very rare case.

Agreed. However, as a Windows developper, I will never ever try to use `~` to reach home, my first reflex (if I am agnostic to Python path policy) would be to use `%UserProfile%`. In that case, `expandvars` is far more important than `expanduser`.

Given that this cross-platform case is very poorly handled by Python, I agree with Gael to the fact that we should let the user find its own path (how poetic).

I was just saying that, on Windows, the canonical way to refer to the home directory is to use the environment variable `%UserProfile%` and thus, applying `expandvars` on the path is more important than applying `expandpath`. This was to underline the fact that `expandpath` is not mandatory and that, in any case, there is no ""good"" way in python to handle path.

Nope. Because we raise an error only if the directory one step above

The idea is to keep as much as possible a clean history of commits. Maybe you can learn how to use git from the command line along with github [here](https://help.github.com/articles/good-resources-for-learning-git-and-github).
