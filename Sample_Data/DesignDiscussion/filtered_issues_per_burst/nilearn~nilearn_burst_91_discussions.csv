I know that it is the new URL but what is the difference with the previous one? Maybe the used an update version of CPAC for the preproc? I just would like to be sure that we are still fetching the same data.

Good point. Plots looks surprising. It is not failing with error but fails drastically in finding correct levels leading to masking out entire background.

We give two values through the `levels`parameter which corresponds to the thresholds of the contour we want to draw: One is positive and the other one is negative. We give a list of colors as parameter to associate a different color to each contour. Additionally, we plot them with thick line widths: We give only one value so that it is used for both contours.
