4,issue_comment,305,pycqa,astroid,dbaum,2016-01-15 16:22:15,"Thanks!

I'm new to using github, etc.  Is there something I should have done to
make the pull easier for you?  Should I have combined the commits
together?  Should I have not tried to synced with upstream/master?

I'm asking because it is likely that I'll have a few more small patches to
astroid in the near future and I want to make things as smooth as possible
for you.

I prefer to have the commits squashed if they are not part of a bigger feature, in that case having some smaller chunks makes more sense. Also you should use rebase for feature branches, so that you won't be needing syncing with the upstream/master. It should be good after that, the cherry-picking is something that I must do, since we have multiple branches of development at the moment.

Thanks for the (future) contributions, let me know if there is something I could help you with.

6,issue_comment,305,pycqa,astroid,dbaum,2016-01-15 16:38:46,"I'm trying to understand the workflow.  Should I be doing my work on a
brach, keep my master at (or behind) the upstream master, then rebase my
feature branch to master and squash the commits at that point?  Something
like:

git checkout -b new-feature master
git commit -a -m ""some work""
git commit -a -m ""some more work""

# I'm a little fuzzy on exactly what commands to use here.  The idea is to

bring my

# master up to date with the upstream master.

git pull upsstream/master

# Go back to working on my fix...

git checkout new-feature
git commit -a -m ""even more work""

# Clean things up before a pull request.

git rebase -i master

2,issue_comment,307,pycqa,astroid,dbaum,2016-01-15 17:52:39,"More info: upon success the last two values from getattr() are 

<BoundMethod **new** of **builtin**.type at 0x4597724240
<BoundMethod **new** of **builtin**.object at 0x4597883472

on failure they are:

<BoundMethod **new** of **builtin**.object at 0x4529744784
<BoundMethod **new** of **builtin**.type at 0x4529787216

So it comes down to the ordering of object and type and one has an args with fromlineno=0 and the other has fromlineno=1.

3,issue_comment,307,pycqa,astroid,dbaum,2016-01-15 17:59:45,"Now I'm very confused.  When running just the one test file it looks like the fromlineno on both type and object are 0.  When running all tests via test discovery then the args for type seem to have fromlineno=1.  But I'm not even sure this is 100% true.  I'm out of my depth here.

4,issue_comment,307,pycqa,astroid,PCManticore,2016-01-15 19:53:49,"There's also https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/issues/195 for tracking this issue, which has nothing to do with the order of the results of getattr. The problem is caused by https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/blob/master/astroid/node_classes.py#L387, which uses as a line number, in case one is not defined for a node, the first one of the children or the parents of the node. This happens usually with builtin modules, since there is no way to find out on which lines they actually are. The approach is definitely not a good idea and the fix would be to remove fixed_source_line altogether and leave such nodes with a line number not set. While this is rather easy, the hard thing is going through pylint and see where this might trip an exception or something undefined. Unfortunately I didn't have time to look over pylint for this issue.
