IMHO it obfuscates them slightly by adding some boiler-plate plotting code that is not directly relevant to the functionality that the example is supposed to demonstrate.

Also something we need to remember each time we change an example is to make sure this doesn't affect the documentation. In this particular case one of the ICA plot is in the website home page carousel. It is also used in other places, for example try `git grep 'plot_canica.*\.png'` for the complete list.
