Good point. So what we should do would be, in map_show, to set a
threshold a bit below the minimum contour, so that the mechanism of
bounding box is reused.

I've tried something in this direction in
https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/1459 . It's a rough sketch done
while listening to a talk. @fliem, can you check that it solves your
problem.
