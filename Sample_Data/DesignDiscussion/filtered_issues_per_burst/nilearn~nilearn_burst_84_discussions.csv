6,issue_comment,1185,nilearn,nilearn,MartinPerez,2016-07-22 16:50:34,"I tested that adding in line 98 of draw_2d:

if self.direction == 'l':
      self.ax.invert_xaxis()

after 
self.add_object_bounds((xmin_, xmax_, zmin_, zmax_))

fixes my contrast images, moreover I deleted from line 659 the original inversion, since its not necessary there anymore and due to the bug would be reset anyway.

It is important to verify that line 1347 of add_graph is also not affected by this bug. I think it is not.

I think changing the code inside draw 2d would be better than checking bound values since the reason of the inversion becomes explicit and its dependence on self.direction is also clear.

7,issue_comment,1185,nilearn,nilearn,MartinPerez,2016-07-27 09:19:22,"@AlexandreAbraham I see your point. Its true I am assuming draw2d to be called once at the end. I agree then with your solution.

Just to clarify the reason there is a separate x_axis inversion in add_graph is because the connectomics code kind of overrides the glass brain implementation when I looked at the logic details. So I was forced to add a separate inversion call there after the markers and links were added. So If I read well the logic the two would never be called together.
