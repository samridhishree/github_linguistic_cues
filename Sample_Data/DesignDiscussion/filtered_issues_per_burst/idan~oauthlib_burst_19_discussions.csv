In the meantime you could achieve this by passing in a custom token generator, for example

```
from your_validator import the_validator
from oauthlib.common import generate_token
from oauthlib.oauth2 import WebApplicationServer

def keep_refresh_tokens(request, refresh_token=False):
    return request.refresh_token if refresh_token else generate_token()

server = WebApplicationServer(the_validator, token_generator=keep_refresh_tokens)
```

just realized the above solution does not work for me because I am using Server instead of WebApplicationServer.
I could use BackendApplicationServer and LegacyApplicationServer and decide which one gets to process the request, but is there any reason that Server, the all inclusive one, does not support that param?

sort it out tonight.

This will not break your work around with a custom token generator but if you want to get rid of the work around simple use

```
 def rotate_refresh_token(self, request):
     return False

to keep the previous refresh token.

I'm hesitant to change `license='BSD'` however since that was set after problems with a multi line licence when packaging for various rpm based distros due to flawed setup.py bdist_rpm #81. That might not be the case anymore but pretty sure it is...

4,issue_comment,187,idan,oauthlib,Ryan-K,2013-07-03 04:01:00,"@lepture That is correct. As I stated, I'm aware that Server is going away. However, there's dependent projects that depend on the Server class provided by oauthlib. See: https://github.com/ib-lundgren/flask-oauthprovider/blob/master/flask_oauthprovider.py#L12

Sadly, there's no branch for the existing 0.4.2 release for an update, so I had to open this request against master. I haven't looked at the status of the refactor, nor what the impact will be on dependent projects supporting OAuth1, but I suspect that addressing this issue on the 0.4.2 release is a good idea.

In the meantime, I'm using the branch from my repo to resolve the issue.

OAuth1 provider is not finished yet, there are some bugs in oauthlib now, and it will be ready after the next release of oauthlib.

There's many ways to implement things, and while flask_oauthprovider certainly has some issues, a bunch of people have been making updates recently and the latest versions are relatively stable, which is what's important for my current needs.

Thankfully, this is all pretty modular so its pretty easy to swap out for flask-oauthlib... I'll certainly be watching it!

Thanks again!

flask very well and are in a much better spot to create a great and easy to
use extension than I will ever be with flask-oauthprovider. If you can
transition over please do so :)

I'll look into what I can do with flask-oauthprovider moving forward to not
break existing implementations when I get back from Canada next week and am
no longer working solely from an android phone...

4,issue_comment,186,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-06-30 19:16:28,"Thanks for the PR @scfarley. Catching index error for malformed auth header is a great start. I think we can easily improve the resilience even more by returning an empty list if the Authorization header does not start with 'OAuth'. 

```
if authorization_header.startswith(auth_scheme):
    authorization_header = authorization_header.replace(auth_scheme, '', 1)
    items = parse_http_list(authorization_header)
    try:
        return list(parse_keqv_list(items).items())
    except (IndexError, ValueError):
        raise ValueError('Malformed authorization header')
else:
    return []

5,issue_comment,186,idan,oauthlib,scfarley,2013-07-01 15:24:54,"I agree with having it return sooner if the header does not start with ""OAuth "".  However, would it better to raise ValueError in this case anyway?  In oauthlib's view, it is malformed even if it is valid for a different scheme.

6,issue_comment,186,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-07-02 14:55:37,"Yes ValueError would be better. I thought the spec mentioned only include parameters if OAuth auth header is present, but reading it now it is clear that it is for any auth header so an error is correct. Fancy updating the PR?
