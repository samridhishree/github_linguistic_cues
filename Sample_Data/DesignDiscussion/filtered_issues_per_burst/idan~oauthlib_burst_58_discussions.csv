4,issue_comment,498,idan,oauthlib,lepture,2017-10-27 17:44:45,"Actually there is a way to register your own signature method.

This **HMAC-SHA256** is not a part of the specification in RFC. This patch should not be included in this repo.",nan,nan
8,pull_request_commit_comment,498,idan,oauthlib,ViktorHaag,2017-10-27 18:21:43,"Agreed. Note that my comment didn't claim it was in RFC5849, but defined in RFC4634 (as one of the suite of accepted Secure Hash Algorithms beyond SHA-1).

I took 5849's provision of three signature methods as _not exclusive_. In section 3.4, it says ""OAuth _does not mandate_ a particular signature method"" (my emphasis), and so it seems useful, with little harm, to add support for SHA2-family signing methods.

If the maintainers would prefer to have clients add support for more modern signing methods via extension, rather than provided in the library, I can understand that decision. I would have thought having the support in-library would at least help clients ensure consistency, but it's clearly not my decision.",be7d482a5d5696ea8aa468dc8f31a0188bc74033,"(18, '', u'oauthlib/oauth1/rfc5849/signature.py')"

10,pull_request_commit_comment,498,idan,oauthlib,ViktorHaag,2017-10-27 19:14:35,"Yes, I understand your point. I had assumed from the comments in #388, that the blocking factor here was a lack of testing and documentation, and not the idea in the first place. It was or that reason that I decided to help by ""finishing"" the original PR. If the maintainer group would prefer not to include it, that's fine: I'm glad there is a way to extend the package usefully.",be7d482a5d5696ea8aa468dc8f31a0188bc74033,"(18, '', u'oauthlib/oauth1/rfc5849/signature.py')"

I don't see the harm in providing this implementation to our users.
It's a pretty common usecase.",nan,nan

Feel free to add yourselves to the AUTHORS file.

@lepture If you strongly disagree let's chat about this over email.
We can always revert before making a new release.",nan,nan
