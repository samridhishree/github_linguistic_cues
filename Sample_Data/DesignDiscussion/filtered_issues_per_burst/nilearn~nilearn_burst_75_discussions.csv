NiftiLabelsMasker stores the label atlas in `labels_img_`. The `mask_img`parameter can be used to exclude voxels outside of the Brain. Meaning that if zone région from the labels has a part inside of the Braun and one outside (as defined by mask_img) then the mean of the voxels inside the brain is averaged at transform.

We are not showing any comparisons here.

I'd rather have a more explicit comment than making this more complex.

An estimator is not valid scikit-learn if fit does not return self.
