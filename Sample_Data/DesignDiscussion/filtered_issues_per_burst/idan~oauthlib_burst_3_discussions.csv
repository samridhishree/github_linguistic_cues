Added support for extracting query parameters as per 3.4.1.3.1.
The parameters does not have to be unique, thus I have modified for use of a list of tuples instead of a dictionary
The parameters were escaped one time to much, removed.
Both client and access secret can be empty, not only access. Per 3.4.2.
Added a few tests based on the RFC and http://hueniverse.com/oauth/guide/authentication/

o = OAuth(client_key=""some key"", client_secret=""secret"")
header = o.auth_header(""http://www.example.com/authorize"")

where header will be a string formatted for use as an Authorization header in a request.

5,issue_comment,8,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2012-03-16 10:32:30,"Updated now, hope those changes were what you had in mind. 

Have a vague memory of reading in the spec somewhere that the client_key is optional but very highly recommended and I am not aware of any service that does not use it or why they would not. Since I cant link to it as of now and since it does not make sense not to use it I left it as a mandatory argument.

https://github.com/ib-lundgren/oauthlib/blob/785fe3cd04560d81331c6a7cbac6b6a95e85118f/oauthlib/oauth.py#L181

Please update this validation to reflect the new state of required vs optional parameters.
