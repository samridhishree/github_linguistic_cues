2,issue_comment,284,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2014-10-24 13:50:13,"The current implementation is working as intended but the documentation should be updated.

As of next release...
- On the provider side you, e.g. in `validator.save_bearer_token`, can use `token.scopes` to access this list of scope strings.
- On the client side side you can first load the dict with json.loads and then use `oauthlib.oauth.OAuth2Token` to access the scope as a list. (This will happen automatically in extensions like requests-oauthlib). 

```
>>> from oauthlib.oauth2 import OAuth2Token
>>> token = OAuth2Token(json.loads(request_body))
['https://example.com/userProfile', 'https://example.com/pictures']
```

If you fancy updating the docs that'd be awesome :)
