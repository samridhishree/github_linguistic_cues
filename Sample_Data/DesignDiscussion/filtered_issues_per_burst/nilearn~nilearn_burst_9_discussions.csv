OK, but then please use 'nisl.signal.clean'. 'import as' is strongly
frowned upon in general because it creates a vocabulary that is
coder-specific.

Naming conventions: n_confounds rather then confound_number

In docstrings, we usually say ""array-like"", rather than ""numpy.ndarray"", as other objects should work.

The return section is not correctly formatted. It won't build the docs right.

The remark on ordering faster is true only for numpy belove 1.7. Anyhow, I would try doing something like:

var = np.copy(series)
var **= 2
var = var.sum(axis=0)

I believe that this should always be fast (not tested, please correct me if I am wrong).

Technically, if you can store int8 in Niftis, you don't need a memory
copy:

```
In [4]: a = np.ones(10, dtype=np.int8)

Still, I agree on the fact that the name is confusing. I made a proposal at the very beginning of this thread that nobody commented on: adding an option to apply_mask() to distinguish between the regions and fMRI data cases. That would be a way to get rid of apply_mask_to_regions().

Another way to get it out of the way would be to change the signature of apply_regions(), and to make it take non-masked input. I think we'll hit performance issues by doing this, that's why I didn't go for this solution.

In terms of API, I still am not a huge fan of the duo: apply_mask_to_regions and apply_regions. I think that I would prefer an option 'mask' to apply_regions', that, if not None, would apply the mask.

I think that we need to detrend the signals :). This is not terribly important here, because of the high_pass filter, but still, I think that this is a good habit to give to people.

As for the detrending, it was already done (line 81), but independently of nisl.signals.clean(). The reason why I did it that way is that high_variance_confounds() must operate on detrended signals, and clean() too. The best way was to detrend the signals once, and not repeat the detrending in clean(). However, mvt_confounds could have a trend in them as well, and in the current state, they're not detrended. I added a call to _detrend() to clean to fix that. This is however rather convoluted for a low-level programmer, so I'll think of something clearer in the very near future.

This file uses only functions and no transformers on purpose: the goal is to show the low-level API to advanced users. If this API isn't clear, there is no hope to get something simple at the transformer level. When the transformer API is ready, I'll create a second example file, doing the same thing.

- Vocabulary: ""maps"" and ""labels"" designate respectively fuzzy regions (possibly intersecting), and flat regions (non intersecting). The former being defined using weights in several 3D arrays, the latter using labels in a single 3D array. This vocabulary is consistent with Scipy's (see e.g. scipy.ndimage.measurements.label or .find_objects). ""images"", abbreviated ""img"" are 3D arrays, with a mandatory affine (even a trivial one). ""signals"" is a series of values extracted from a single voxel. The word ""timeseries"" is somehow specific to resting-state acquisitions: a signal is not necessarily evenly sampled, which is suggested by the term ""timeseries"".
- Separate functions must exist for maps and labels processing. This will make cleaner API and permit some optimizations by using shortcuts in some cases.
- Every 3D or 4D array must come with an affine, to permit automatic resampling. This implies passing niimgs as input in every such case, and not just numpy arrays.

I suggest to create the following functions (that would replace the existing un|apply_regions): 
- signals_from_labels() and signals_from_maps(): for extracting signals from regions defined by labels and maps respectively. Both functions take niimgs as inputs, and return a 2D numpy array, containing signals as columns.
- img_from_labels() and img_from_maps(): for inverting signals_from_*() functions. Both take a 2D array as input, and ouput a NiftiImage.

and make the modifications:
- high_variance_confounds() should take images as input, not signals.
- rename ""regions_are_overlapping"" to ""maps_are_overlapping""
- remove all the conversion functions (_regions___to__), possibly with the exception of those involving labels, because they might prove useful, especially _regions_array_to_labels().

I don't expect everyone to agree on this, but it seems a reasonable compromise to me.

So what comes out of ROIs is not signals? Seems that the API that your

- extraction of signals from regions and back are made using the following functions: img_to_signals_labels, img_to_signals_maps, signals_to_img_labels, signals_to_img_maps. They replace all the previous functions, including those for format conversion (array to list to labels, etc.).
- created NiftiLabelsMasker, which basically does the same thing as NiftiMasker, but with regions defined as labels instead of just an single mask. Most features are implemented, with the notable exception of joblib and resampling (see below).
- an example have been created to show the use of the new NiftiLabelsMasker: plot_regions_covariance_obj.py. This script is very close to plot_regions_covariance.py, which only uses functions, and no object. One of them is probably to remove, feel free to comment on this point.
- in order to slightly shrink the example script, and simplify their usage, I added a new module _image_ and a new function image.high_variance_confounds(). It does the same thing as signals.high_variance_confounds(), but takes niimgs as input, not signals. It was required to avoid calling check_niimg() and doing some convoluted things inside the examples. See the diff for commit b6d9af3 for more details.

As this pull request has been there for a while yet, I think this would be a good idea to stop implementing features, and get ready for a merge.

Yes, but if you are inheriting from TransformerMixin, you are inheriting
such method.

The question is whether we should teach the user to use it. I think that
I believe so.

Good point. If we keep the maps to label functionality, we might need this.
Else, I don't think we need it. However right now it is not used, is it?

@AlexandreAbraham is actually doing things that are way more complex, so
he is not really relying on such functionality.

It's more that they are misleading: you should implement it only if it
provides a benefit, else just use inheritance.

Joblibing intermediate step is useful when you are in a parameter exploration step : if you want to clean your signal properly and do not want to smooth your data at each try, you may want to cache the call to smooth. Once your parameter are set, you want this step to be executed in no time.
