I don't see a development branch mentioned here https://oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/contributing.html or from the README.

The latest set of merged pull reqs were against `master`, eg: #69, #67, #66

The branches against this project are named `master`, `oauth2_provider`, `oauth2_draft25_server`, `use_request_objects`, it's not obvious which of these you're referring to.

@ib-lundgren @kennethreitz - I have considered contributing, but I think it'd be more like to be in the form of helping maintain a Django implementation, ideally also contributing compatible auth classes to django-rest-framework and django-tastypie to help converge the community on a single well documented and well maintained implementation.

I don't know whether that's pre-mature at the moment, and I'm a bit unsure what the current state of the project is...
- Should I consider OAuth1 useable yet?
- Will the OAuth2 server API be different or are all the differences implementation-only?
- Are there many/any well maintained implementations using this yet, or anyone else planning a Django implementation?
  I see https://github.com/craigbruce/django-oauth, but It's not clear how complete that currently is.

I think OAuth1 is usable and the next step really is to get some implementations going to weed out the remaining quirks and features needed.

```

```

OAuth2 is quite different from OAuth 1 in that it supports a great many more variations of obtaining tokens as well as types of tokens. I'm working quite actively on OAuth 2 provider support in the oauth2_provider branch but it needs a fair amount of work before it is complete.

I'm not sure whether you would want to mix OAuth 1 and 2 in the same extension or whether it makes more sense to split it into django-oauth and django-oauth2. It certainly is possible to mix them and differentiate between oauth 1 & 2 requests. Django more or less enforcing users to use their ORM makes creating a fully working drop-in oauth (1 or 2) provider extension possible. It could basically boil down to users simply decorating the views they want to protect and configure an authorization page.

```
Are there many/any well maintained implementations using this yet, or anyone else planning a Django implementation? I see https://github.com/craigbruce/django-oauth, but It's not clear how complete that currently is.
```

I'm fairly oblivious to who are actually using OAuthLib and do not really know of any (first time i see the one you mention there). If you have time to do some research into whats available and contact those working on various implementations in order to join efforts that would be super awesome. I would love to collaborate more closely with people using OAuthLib, especially for the purpose of providing OAuth. \* note to self - encourage people to get in touch somewhere *.

Let me know if you'd like to have a chat over a G+ hangout to discuss this in more detail.

I've not really kept track of the status anywhere so guess I might as well give the update here as anywhere else.

My current plan is along the lines of:
- Add a number of convenience methods to common.Request to facilitate parameter finding for grant_types
- Sort out resource endpoint error reporting and go over authorization and token endpoint error reporting and make sure it mimics the spec and my plans
- Bearer token token_type estimation
- Weed out the most broken bits of the endpoints and grant types by implementing extensive endpoint tests
- Play around with making a basic but fully functional oauth provider with Django or Flask to find any missing features, annoyances and see if the API is at level of usability I'm happy with
- Write some docs ;)
- MAC, JWT, SAML token support
- More docs ;)

I'm already working on some of this but I've not pushed it yet. Expect to see incremental improvements each week.

tell me more about Django basic oauth provider. How can I help you?
I'm interested in oauth 2 for Installed applications like described at google documentation [1].

I think that a good starting point is to learn how google do it and start write some 
Django views that mimics the google way of do things. I mean a Django app or view to register your application,
branding information and get your generated clients ID like google api console [2]. It can be a django admin page
for now.

What do you think?

I have many ideas for a django-oauth extension but afraid I won't be able to get to it before the summer. It's a good idea to have a look at the Google API Console and spend time streamlining the processes around registering and maintaining clients. Essentially such an extension could boil, if done right, reduce the complexity of authorizing api use with OAuth down to a simple decorator. Now that is the future, for now I'll focus on getting the OAuth 2 support in oauthlib working, spec compliant and well tested.

Yes, please!  There are very good reasons to want to use oauthlib without
requests, e.g. as a straight up replacement for the long abandoned oauth.  In
fact, a little user guide for converting from oauth to oauthlib would be
fantastic.  It's not a difficult conversion, although it's a bit of a brain
twister at first because of the different terminology.

Yep.  Notice the Uploaded date :)

Okay, piston-mini-client is one package I'm working on.  This is not fully
tested yet (note the as yet unported PLAINTEXT signature method), but it
should give you an idea of what I had to change to do the conversion.  Once I
get this working, I might even submit a more detailed blurb for the
documentation.
