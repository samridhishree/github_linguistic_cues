It creates a larger temporary array. But that may be premature
optimization. On the other hand, your preference may also be premature
optimization :).

On one hand, my solution allocates a temporary array of negligible size (given my prior information on what confounds may look like). On the other hand, it is faster and IMHO easier to read than yours.

As I said, it a personal opinion, and I also love to nitpick ;).

OK, I addressed your nitpick. But I think that we should focus on the
bigger picture.

Addressed. Let's wait for CI.
