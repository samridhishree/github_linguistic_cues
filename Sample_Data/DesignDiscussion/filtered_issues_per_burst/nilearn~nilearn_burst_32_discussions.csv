If we adopt the conventions that have been suggested to me, ""right button press"" should be called ""right button press (auditory and visual cue)"". Eventually, we would have ""right vs left button press"" renamed as ""right button press (auditory and visual cue) vs left button press (auditory and visual cue)"", which is very long.
Actually, ""calculation (auditory and visual cue) + sentence listening and reading vs button press"" IS very long and unreadable. Besides, it cannot hold on one line, which makes documentation difficult to write.

Therefore, I dare insisting on the fact that I would like to call ""calculation"" the current ""calculation (auditory and visual cue)"" contrast. This will for instance simplify ""calculation (auditory and visual cue) + sentence listening and reading vs button press"" into ""calculation + sentences vs button press"".

Sorry for the short answer yesterday, it was very late so I've been brief.

The first thing I've spotted is that you do:

```
from nilearn.utils import *
```

which means that you don't have the latest version of nilearn installed. This shouldn't be an issue but this would be the first thing to try. Then you could try to run it on several computers with different configs. On my side, I usually have the latest version of packages.

You can also run this command:

```
pip freeze
```

to get the list of all your modules and their versions. Please post it there if upgrading nilearn is not enough. On which system are you running ?

We actually circumvented the memory overload problem (that occurred on

template, which constitutes the search space for the searchlight analysis.
This works fine now, but does unfortunately not allow to tell where the
initial problem was coming from. I still suspect the masker...

I did run make from the nilearn directory (as described)?
If I ended up in the doc directory that must have been where the Makefile left me...

After the git pull I still had to manually change 
 ./doc/_build/html/_downloads/plot_nifti_advanced.py
 ./doc/_build/html/_downloads/plot_old_canica_resting_state.py
 ./doc/_build/html/_downloads/plot_ica_resting_state.py
 ./doc/auto_examples/plot_nifti_advanced.py
 ./doc/auto_examples/plot_old_canica_resting_state.py
 ./doc/auto_examples/plot_ica_resting_state.py
 ./plot_nifti_advanced.py
 ./plot_old_canica_resting_state.py
 ./plot_ica_resting_state.py
to replace io by input_data

Also in 
 emacs doc/Makefile 
there is a mention of niearn which should probably be nilearn.

After doing all that the commands <in the nilearn directory>
make clean && make install

result in the following output: 
![install log](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/5262793/1000671/81904a62-0a52-11e3-80e3-4977c30e6433.jpg)
--another jpg text file--

I've done this a couple of time in a row, and in short
1. the example scripts only need to run one time, except the plot_old_canica_resting_state.py script, which is called twice in every 'make install', and is not successful
2. the pdf file is not built (possibly because of a syntax error in \FancyVerb [which I dont know]?)
3. after the pdf generation, another clone attempt also fails.

Hope this report is of use, very happy that the clustering script works.

Thanks for your feedback ! We try as much as possible to run compilation from scratch but I think my local repository is polluted by temporary files.

To use nilearn, you do not need to 'make' it. Normally, cloning the git repository is enough:

```
git clone https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn.git
python plot_rest_clustering.py
```

... should work (nilearn will be imported locally). If you really want to install it, use:

```
python setup.py install
```

I will try to fix the bugs you pointed out as fast as possible but I have other tasks pending. I hope that these installation problems did not dissuade you tu use nilearn !

Do not hesitate to give us a feedback and, if you have an interesting experiment using open data, then maybe we could add it as an example !

Best,

Alexandre.

This will happen in September, when Loic joins us and works on
visualization. In the mean time, we focus on algorithms.

NiftiMasker, as ideally they should be computed on the non preprocessed
files and applied to the preprocessed files.

Computing non-specific confounds on preprocessed image is dangerous, for
instance, as pointed out by Basile on Tuesday, the global signal mean
will contain strong traces of the resampling done in the realign step.

In terms of software design, when we integrate the HV confounds, I would
like to do this in terms of a transform, but that means that we need to
change the design of nilearn to take dictionaries for X, and that's a
much larger design work that we will undertake later.

If you need it for your own codebase, for instance because you don't have
access to the raw data, I suggest that you sublass the NiftiMasker that
you are using to add the functionality in your codebase. It should not be
hard to do the subclassing.

hold.

In contrast, on postprocessed images they might also take into account variance introduced during the alignment process. Physiologically induced confounds should be available both before and after preprocessing the data, so not sure whether that should make a big difference.

OK, based on my experience it works better when using the raw data.

Anyhow, as long as we haven't a clear idea on these choices, I am not
very enthousiastic at the idea of making high-level objects. I would like
to get empirical validation of the pipeline before implementing it in
nilearn before I am worried about the combinatorial explosion of options.

I think that we have more to do before. I also think that we need to
change the way we pass information in and out of objects before we
tackle this problem.

OK, so we do have the problem, and it must indeed be solved...

Yes, but we are quite busy right now. I guess that I am more interested
in moving nilearn forward than having the perfect dataset download API.

That's a great solution! That's exactly the kind of compromises that we
need.

I am asking because it would make sens that the Canopy Python sets up packages in a different location.

However installing with the --user option using canopy python is still successful in the sense that nilearn in the ~/.local path is then accessible to the system python - which however does not have all the other dependencies.

Canopy seems to have its own, separate user path at `Enthought/Canopy_64bit/User/lib/python2.7/site-packages`. If I leave the --user option while installing, this is where nilearn ends up. I am not sure what the difference is to `Enthought/Canopy_64bit/System/lib/python2.7/site-packages` which contains less packages.
