Example with the code taken from [examples/02_decoding/plot_haxby_anova_svm.py](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/examples/02_decoding/plot_haxby_anova_svm.py):
- This the current version:

``` python
# Load the behavioral data
import numpy as np
y, session = np.loadtxt(haxby_dataset.session_target[0]).astype(""int"").T
conditions = np.recfromtxt(haxby_dataset.conditions_target[0])['f0']
```
- Here is the `pandas` version:

``` python
# Load the behavioral data
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv(haxby_dataset.session_target[0], header=None,
                 names=['y', 'session'], delimiter=' ')
y = df.y.values
session = df.session.values
df = pd.read_csv(haxby_dataset.conditions_target[0], header=None,
                 names=['f0', 'f1'], delimiter=' ')
conditions = df.f0.values.astype('S12')
```

But maybe this is not the best example or I don't have a good usage of pandas.

I seem to remember that it is fairly important to have the metric to
really be the Cramer-Rao metric.

That said, we could do it the other way around, and apply 1/sqrt(2) on
the diagonal, which would be probably more intuitive.

Do you a minimal usecase reproducing the problem by any chance?

Thanks!

I prepared a minimal case for the `data_2d_list` problem. I can't reproduce the first issue though, will keep checking.
Please check it here:
