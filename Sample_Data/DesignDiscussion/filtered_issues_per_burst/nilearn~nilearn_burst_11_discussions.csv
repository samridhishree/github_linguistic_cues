I understand your point of view on regions masking, and that keeping the labels after masking could be useful. However, integrating this in apply_mask_to_regions() would lead to an inconsistent API imo. The output of apply_mask_to_regions() is designed to be used as input to apply_regions(), nothing else in the present state.

I used the word ""unapply"" to get a consistent pair of function names (apply_mask / unmask being not consistent enough for me).

that such a function should exist in the public API. I does not serve a

Still, I agree on the fact that the name is confusing. I made a proposal at the very beginning of this thread that nobody commented on: adding an option to apply_mask() to distinguish between the regions and fMRI data cases. That would be a way to get rid of apply_mask_to_regions().

Another way to get it out of the way would be to change the signature of apply_regions(), and to make it take non-masked input. I think we'll hit performance issues by doing this, that's why I didn't go for this solution.

In terms of API, I still am not a huge fan of the duo: apply_mask_to_regions and apply_regions. I think that I would prefer an option 'mask' to apply_regions', that, if not None, would apply the mask.

I think that we need to detrend the signals :). This is not terribly important here, because of the high_pass filter, but still, I think that this is a good habit to give to people.

23,issue_comment,47,nilearn,nilearn,pgervais,2013-04-24 07:22:24,"I fixed most of the issues you raised (about plot_regions_covariance.py). 

As for the detrending, it was already done (line 81), but independently of nisl.signals.clean(). The reason why I did it that way is that high_variance_confounds() must operate on detrended signals, and clean() too. The best way was to detrend the signals once, and not repeat the detrending in clean(). However, mvt_confounds could have a trend in them as well, and in the current state, they're not detrended. I added a call to _detrend() to clean to fix that. This is however rather convoluted for a low-level programmer, so I'll think of something clearer in the very near future.

This file uses only functions and no transformers on purpose: the goal is to show the low-level API to advanced users. If this API isn't clear, there is no hope to get something simple at the transformer level. When the transformer API is ready, I'll create a second example file, doing the same thing.

26,issue_comment,47,nilearn,nilearn,pgervais,2013-04-30 12:14:57,"After long discussions with both @AlexandreAbraham, @GaelVaroquaux, @bthirion, and others, here is a new proposal for the low-level API. The important points being:
- Vocabulary: ""maps"" and ""labels"" designate respectively fuzzy regions (possibly intersecting), and flat regions (non intersecting). The former being defined using weights in several 3D arrays, the latter using labels in a single 3D array. This vocabulary is consistent with Scipy's (see e.g. scipy.ndimage.measurements.label or .find_objects). ""images"", abbreviated ""img"" are 3D arrays, with a mandatory affine (even a trivial one). ""signals"" is a series of values extracted from a single voxel. The word ""timeseries"" is somehow specific to resting-state acquisitions: a signal is not necessarily evenly sampled, which is suggested by the term ""timeseries"".
- Separate functions must exist for maps and labels processing. This will make cleaner API and permit some optimizations by using shortcuts in some cases.
- Every 3D or 4D array must come with an affine, to permit automatic resampling. This implies passing niimgs as input in every such case, and not just numpy arrays.

I suggest to create the following functions (that would replace the existing un|apply_regions): 
- signals_from_labels() and signals_from_maps(): for extracting signals from regions defined by labels and maps respectively. Both functions take niimgs as inputs, and return a 2D numpy array, containing signals as columns.
- img_from_labels() and img_from_maps(): for inverting signals_from_*() functions. Both take a 2D array as input, and ouput a NiftiImage.

and make the modifications:
- high_variance_confounds() should take images as input, not signals.
- rename ""regions_are_overlapping"" to ""maps_are_overlapping""
- remove all the conversion functions (_regions___to__), possibly with the exception of those involving labels, because they might prove useful, especially _regions_array_to_labels().

I don't expect everyone to agree on this, but it seems a reasonable compromise to me.
Tell me your thoughts before I start implementing this for good.

So what comes out of ROIs is not signals? Seems that the API that your

me).

Getting a precise yet general definition is kind of tricky in the present case. The idea is to transform a set of images, usually represented by a 4D array (3 dimensions for space, one for scans) into a 2D array, (1 dimension for space, 1 for scan). The column of the 2D array is what I call signals. 

Everybody following this discussion has understood what I meant. This might not be the case for all future users.

OK, that definition seems to me to be a good one. In general I think that

- extraction of signals from regions and back are made using the following functions: img_to_signals_labels, img_to_signals_maps, signals_to_img_labels, signals_to_img_maps. They replace all the previous functions, including those for format conversion (array to list to labels, etc.).
- created NiftiLabelsMasker, which basically does the same thing as NiftiMasker, but with regions defined as labels instead of just an single mask. Most features are implemented, with the notable exception of joblib and resampling (see below).
- an example have been created to show the use of the new NiftiLabelsMasker: plot_regions_covariance_obj.py. This script is very close to plot_regions_covariance.py, which only uses functions, and no object. One of them is probably to remove, feel free to comment on this point.
- in order to slightly shrink the example script, and simplify their usage, I added a new module _image_ and a new function image.high_variance_confounds(). It does the same thing as signals.high_variance_confounds(), but takes niimgs as input, not signals. It was required to avoid calling check_niimg() and doing some convoluted things inside the examples. See the diff for commit b6d9af3 for more details.

As this pull request has been there for a while yet, I think this would be a good idea to stop implementing features, and get ready for a merge. For this reason, I focused on the core problems, and let aside some convenience features like joblib-caching and resampling. I know resampling is no detail, but I think integrating it in the API correctly will require a pull-request on its own.

Joblibing intermediate step is useful when you are in a parameter exploration step : if you want to clean your signal properly and do not want to smooth your data at each try, you may want to cache the call to smooth. Once your parameter are set, you want this step to be executed in no time.

My concern of the moment is : does it work if I give it a loads of huge files ? ;)

On the other hand, it is important to be able to work even when the connection is not very strong -- of course, this is for a future PR.

Comments may be useful on joblib usage in NiftiLabelsMasker. @AlexandreAbraham this is for you! Most other modifications are technical or of style.
