I'd rather not. This is an internal format that we don't want to expose
to users. I'd rather rely on joblib and the shelve mechanism for this
purpose. Which also means that none of this is exposed to the end user.

If I understand well, @AlexandreAbraham not only runs a given processing many times on the same set of masked images (which joblib is good for), but also runs several different processing on the same images. In the latter case, joblib is kind of awkward to use, even with the (still in progress) references. While I agree that providing a tuple as a niimg is not a good idea, using joblib for this is not (right now) a handy solution either.

representations: some that make sens from a neuroscientific point of
view, and these should absolutely be stored as nifti images, and some
that are mere convenience for speed/caching reasons, and those should be
easily recomputable from neuroscientific data, and thus rely on joblib.
My analysis may be wrong, but I'll need a more precise usecase to be
convinced.

After it's merged, I suggest that you rebase all your branch (all your rebases are belong to us!), because this PR has touched upon a lot of files, and will create conflicts.

Post-merge reviews appreciated anyhow
