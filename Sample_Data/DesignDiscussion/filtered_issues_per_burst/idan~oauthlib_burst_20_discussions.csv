 raise errors.InvalidRequestError(

5,issue_comment,197,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-07-19 19:18:21,"@kdazzle Thanks for the PR!

I initially avoided the use of _create_request because earlier that implementation would cause this to fail because it also checked the request signature (which there is none during this step). It seems like this works well now tho and agree that an update might be in order.

Could you please also update the documentation with the error message thrown if oauth_token is not set on request.

Oh and feel free to push more changes to this PR.

I made the changes you suggested and a couple of others in the endpoints. However, I couldn't find any documentation related to the NotImplementedError, so I didn't make any changes there.

Many bonus points if you add tests for this =)

Feel free to add yourself to authors too.

I haven't been able to do any tests, but I will try to write some soon so that everyone's life (except Travis CI's) can get a bit easier.

9,issue_comment,197,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-07-23 17:08:35,"Looking good. For the tests an ``assert_called_with` similar to below around https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/master/tests/oauth1/rfc5849/endpoints/test_resource.py#L75 (and equiv. for the other endpoints) would go far.

self.validator.validate_timestamp_and_nonce.assert_called_once_with(
