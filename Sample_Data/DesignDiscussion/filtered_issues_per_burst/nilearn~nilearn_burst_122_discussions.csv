Out of interest, would that be only for the examples for now, i.e. we wouldn't add it as a dependency of nilearn?

4,issue_comment,1140,nilearn,nilearn,aabadie,2016-06-21 20:30:23,"I like the idea but I'm wondering if it will really make things clearer for newcomers.

Example with the code taken from [examples/02_decoding/plot_haxby_anova_svm.py](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/examples/02_decoding/plot_haxby_anova_svm.py):
- This the current version:

``` python
# Load the behavioral data
import numpy as np
y, session = np.loadtxt(haxby_dataset.session_target[0]).astype(""int"").T
conditions = np.recfromtxt(haxby_dataset.conditions_target[0])['f0']
```
- Here is the `pandas` version:

``` python
# Load the behavioral data
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv(haxby_dataset.session_target[0], header=None,
                 names=['y', 'session'], delimiter=' ')
y = df.y.values
session = df.session.values
df = pd.read_csv(haxby_dataset.conditions_target[0], header=None,
                 names=['f0', 'f1'], delimiter=' ')
conditions = df.f0.values.astype('S12')
```

But maybe this is not the best example or I don't have a good usage of pandas.

Also, have you tried with a simpler (non-sparse) classifier, e.g. SVM ?

```
Internally the code uses ```scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter1d```.
I see two options to fix this:
- To not accept ```smoothing_fwhm=0.``` rather advice users to specify as ```smoothing_fwhm=None```.
- If somebody argues that 0. is a scalar and acceptable input then we need to ask in SciPy tracker about anything I am missing with ```gaussian_filter1d``` before and after new release.
- You have any equivalent ```sigma``` value when ```fwhm=0``` ?

Please let me know your opinions as this some what important ?

Hello @bthirion , sorry for the late answer.

I think that the extra sharpness you see in the neurovault snapshot is mostly
due to the rendering and the fact that with pycortex, pixels on the screen are
mapped directly into the brain volume. In our case, we first map the mesh
vertices into the volume, then let matplotlib render the surface (by
interpolating surrounding mesh values for each pixel).

Fig. 4 in the pycortex paper (Gao, J. S., Huth, A. G., Lescroart, M. D., &
Gallant, J. L. (2015). Pycortex: an interactive surface visualizer for fMRI.
Frontiers in neuroinformatics, 9.) illustrates that:
![pycortex](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9196501/31687769-8b9666fa-b38a-11e7-9751-c2986623b77c.jpg)



https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4586273/


This mapping of pixels into the image is done by WebGL, a javascript wrapper
around OpenGl, which allows pycortex to do this in reasonable time by performing
the computations on the graphics card.

I think we don't want this because these dependencies are heavy (and obviously
not python libraries), and the code would be much bigger. It is better to get
values for each vertex in the mesh, so that we can rely on the existing nilearn
surface plotting functions and matplotlib for the display. Moreover, someone may
want to use these values interpolated at mesh nodes to do analysis of surface
data (although I don't think I would recommend it).

There is a possibility to get a value for each mesh vertex with pycortex, but as
you can see in the images below the results are closer to ours. This projection
on the cortical mesh, unlike pixel mapping, doesn't require OpenGL.

I have added sampling along a normal to the cortex to what is implemented in
this PR. So now, using the 'kind' keyword, the user can choose between the ball
sampling that we originally proposed, and what is done by pycortex and others:
draw a normal to the cortex, select some points on this normal, interpolate
image values at those points, and average them.

for now, the PR has the two interpolation methods offered in scipy: nearest and
linear. Note that 'nearest' is not taking the value of the voxel nearest to the
vertex: it is taking the voxel nearest to each of several points along the
normal before averaging them. In the same way, linear computes an interpolation
for several points along the normal and averages them. On top of nearest and
linear, pycortex offers the lanczos filter, which is an approximation of an
optimal filter for preserving the frequencies in the image. I can easily add
this as well, but I think the images are very similar (see below), and the
interpolation is much slower: it takes several seconds for one image with the
fsaverage mesh, using all 4 cores and most of the memory of my laptop - so I'd
recommend sticking with scipy's nearest and linear interpolations. (For some
reason, even when choosing 'nearest', using scipy interpolation is several times
slower the indexing we did when I opened the PR, but let's keep it if we want
the linear interpolation).

There are still some extra details in the pycortex images. Some possible explainations:
- pycortex forces you to perform registration of your volume with the surface
  subject using freesurfer. This is much more annoying for the user (e.g. me),
  but there may be a reason for it.
- pycortex wants a full freesurfer subject. There are lots of information in
  there, but one thing which can help have nicer surface plots is that they have
  both the pial and white matter surfaces, and therefore take the values inside
  the cortex, between these surfaces. We only have one surface, so we take
  values symmetrically from both sides of it. This is maybe less fancy, but it
  means that you can use the output of nilearn.datasets.fetch_surf_fsaverage5.
- maybe we need to tune a bit the size of the neighbourhood we use (I'm using 3
  mm)

Finally, it is a bit hard to compare computation times because of pycortex's
caching, but the methods are similar so if you map the mesh (not the pixels) and
use either nearest or linear interpolation, it should be about the same. This
can give an idea:

pycortex:
---------
nearest: 288 ms
linear: 1.81 s
lanczos: 6.65 s

nilearn:
--------
nearest (line): 79 ms
linear (line): 107 ms
ball: 56 ms

If the objective is just to plot one image, all of these are fine (except maybe
lanczos).

I think that all images look kind of similar and the projection doesn't have a
huge impact, which is why probably why caret offers projection methods such as
simply taking the voxel the node falls within, averaging the values of this
voxel's neighbours, averaging values in a cube, or placing a gaussian blob on
the node

After some email discussion on the topic, here is a proposal to make it even more clear what is being done, with potentially huge benefits to seasoned users and perfect transparency for all of those who don't care:

Many of these transformations (here volume to surface projections, but think also volume to volume transformations, ROI extractions, ...) are linear operations on the data vectors. Many of them can be represented as very sparse matrices (e.g. one vertex in this specific surface projection case will not consider the values of more than say 10 voxels).

The idea would be to make this linear transformation explicit and hand it to experienced users if they request it. Ideally this would be done by representing the transformation as a scipy sparse matrix, or, at least as a scipy linear operator (by providing an adjoint/rmatvec transformation in addition to the forward direction). This would aid in

- caching (just save it)
- understandability of the object as well as its cached version (you know what it is and have it in your hands)
- flexibility (advanced users can use them explicitly and mold them to their purposes)
- potential savings in computation for complicated operations (imagine wanting to select values of a surface ROI in fsaverage, maybe a very small ROI. Concatenating volume -> individual surface -> fsaverage -> ROI projector can turn this operation into a linear operation on probably very few voxels of an individual brain. Likewise: you can easily use heavily masked voxel data as a starting point for these projections.)

8,issue_comment,1516,nilearn,nilearn,eickenberg,2017-10-22 23:38:11,"> What's the usecase?

I can think of many. Here are 3

1. This is a first stepping stone to very efficient projectors from subject volume to e.g. mean activations across a cortical atlas defined in fsaverage space. There are so many imaginable conjugations of this setting where you can circumvent blowing dimensionality/memory usage out of proportion in intermediate calculations before collapsing back to a small space. Especially with large amounts of images/subjects this can be beneficial

2. It gives you a immediate access and understanding of what the projector is doing. You could use it easily to understand weird patterns in surface projection due to partial volume effects (e.g. one voxel going across a sulcus and projecting to different and disjoint parts of the surface). Simply doable by analyzing the columns of this projector matrix

3. Educational purposes: Making this sparse matrix representation clear will make it possible to shed light on what possible differences there can be between e.g. a GLM performed before or after surface projection. It turns out that the beta-maps are 1-to-1 translatable if that matrix is invertible. But the noise estimates and thus the activation maps might be different. 

In addition to this they are numpy/scipy objects and contain an understandable representation of the projector. Caching them can be done in a quasi-human-understandable manner.",nan,nan

It does seem small (although I think you want to argue that it is large :) ). If the projection were internally prepared and implemented as a sparse matrix multiplication (leading to no difference in functionality), then 

1. future developers, who may incidentally also be people close to the lab, might understand the linear nature of all these projections just by looking at the code they are working on

1.5 If atlas transformations for fsaverage atlases are incorporated, developers could create efficient projectors under the hood, because they understand that they are nothing other than a choice of linear projection.

2. these sparse matrices **could or could not** be exposed to the user. If exposing these matrices is considered a high maintenance cost because the change is outward-facing and will need to be handled with care, then don't expose it. Just let advanced enough users copy and paste the code use it at their own risk. That said, exposing these might add three lines and a docstring. The only downside is then being bound to maintaining these matrices (and who knows, maybe sparse matrices are slow compared to something more smart, but this can be tested)

because interpolation of data on a regular grid was introduced in 0.14. Before
that, the linear interpolation accepts a bunch of arbitrary points and computes
a delaunay triangulation, which is prohibitively slow - I waited 10 mn for the
2mm MNI template before giving up.
We could:
  - write our own linear interpolation, which would give us the opportunity to
    present it as a sparse matrix, with the same advantages we got from doing
    this for the nearest voxel interpolation.
  - issue a warning and fall back to nearest neighbour interpolation when the
    scipy version is < 0.14. Since the resulting images are almost identical
    (at least qualitatively, i.e. the plots will look the same), this seems
    reasonable to me.

texture here will be a 2d array: each column is a surface map for the corresponding image. plot_surf_stat_map just wants one surface map at a time, try this:

```python
from nilearn import datasets, plotting

brainpedia = datasets.fetch_neurovault(collection_id=1952, max_images=7)
fsaverage = datasets.fetch_surf_fsaverage5()
texture = plotting.vol_to_surf(brainpedia.images, fsaverage.pial_left)

for img_texture in texture.T:
    plotting.plot_surf_stat_map(fsaverage.infl_left, img_texture)

plotting.show()
```

43,issue_comment,1516,nilearn,nilearn,KamalakerDadi,2017-11-15 15:07:49,"* Quickly scanning through Surface plotting PR. The reason for first travis env failure might be. As mentioned in testing function ```test_load_surf_mesh_file_gii``` in nilearn/tests/test_surface.py:
“If nibabel is of older version we skip tests as nibabel does not  support intent argument and intent codes are not handled properly with  older versions”. That's why we don't see the failure in other envs which have nibabel>2.1.0
Given this, we can first try by generating a dummy surface mesh object using ```_generate_surf``` rather than testing with pial_left surface mesh object.
Second try is upto dicussion if we want to skip test.

* Because one of the environment tests without matplotlib it fails if you do ```import matplotlib``` outside plotting module. Because of this all plotting functions are tested by setting the matplotlib backend in nilearn/plotting/__init__.py For instance, see this PR #546

Not necessarily: maybe you already have the fsaverage files on the laptop, so
they don't need to be fetched.

The problem was that test_fetch_mixed_gambles in
nilearn/datasets/tests/test_func.py was using @with_setup(setup_mock), but
forgot to @with_setup(setup_mock, teardown_mock). As a result, after executing

need n points uniformly spread in the unit ball. How I do this now is by drawing
many samples from a uniform distribution over the unit ball, performing k-means
on these monte-carlo samples, and keeping the n centroids.

This is not great, so if you can think of a smarter way, let's change it.

Otherwise, these computed centroids need to be cached in some way: they are
independant of the image and the mesh, and take a little while to compute.
During development, I was using joblib, but I think we could compute the
centroid positions once and for all for a few values of n_samples, e.g. [20, 40,

About performance:
- for one image, there is no big difference, linear takes about x1.5 more time
- for many images, since it is written as a dot product with a sparse matrix, nearest scales much better: for 100 images, linear takes x20 more time (2.86s for linear and 156ms for nearest on my laptop)

How is this for a compromise:
- inside _masked_indices, which was doing a lot of logical_not, I manipulate kept indices, but I return ~kept
- outside this function, masked is used once as-is, twice after doing NOT (if I was returning kept it would be twice as-is, once after taking NOT)

IIUC all Freesurfer subjects have an affine transformation file that can applied to get data into MNI space. This is what we plan to use in MNE to transform to use `plot_glass_brain` for individual subjects, e.g.:

https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pull/4496/files#diff-c38906291c7d4fa5e1df2d494b9c27d2R129

It would be great if the `nilearn` functionality in this PR can be used the same way, in other words, it's compatible with any data already in MNI space -- that seems sufficently general to me.

If you want to extend it to subjects other than `fsaverage` (which has an identity MNI transformation), though, I'd probably do it in a separate PR since this one already has a ton of discussion.
