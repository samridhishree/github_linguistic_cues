- pylint 2.0 depends on an un-released 2.0 version. In the past, we solved this by adding a `dependency_links` with the link to an astroid 2.0 archive in pylint's `__pkginfo__`
- astroid depends on latest pylint for linting. We could try to limit this one to a released version, since it is fine like that. 
If you have some spare cycles, the second approach should be a simple PR.",nan,nan
