No. It needs to be done in the following way:

<pre>
if img.dtype.kind == 'f':
   dtype = img.dtype
elif img.dtype.itemsize == 8:
   dtype = np.float64
else:
   dtype = np.float32
</pre>


this is to avoid at all cost using float64, which consume a lot of memory
and slow computations down.

We should implement a helper function in nilearn._utils.numpy_conversions
that does the above.

Just don't catter for non CV stuff. In the nilearn codebase, the way to
do non-CV stuff will be to give a single value of alpha and l1_ratio to
the objects.

The default of `rescale_alpha` is set to `True` which I fully endorse, because we do not want different numbers of samples changing the effective regularization: This parameter indicates whether or not we put `1. / (2 * n_samples)` in front of the loss instead of `1. / 2.`

We should discuss a) whether `False` for this parameter is ever useful (AFAIK, sklearn does this scaling by default) and b) whether we should talk about a much more interesting scaling which is a scaling as a fraction of `alpha_max`. The only reason not to do this is that we only have an upper bound for `alpha_max` and not the exact value. The upper bound is not unreasonable, though, as it is the `alpha_max` of the corresponding tvl1 variation lasso.

The benefit is that it would reduce the number of lines of code now, and even more in the future when we add more spatial penalties. We could call it 'SpatialNet', to be a bit tongue in cheak :).

So, the prototype of this class would be something like:

<pre>
class SpatialNet:
   def __init__(self, penalty='smooth-lasso', mask=None, ...(usual stuff)):
       ...
  def fit(self, niimgs):
     # Note that here fit takes niimgs, so you will have to use a NiftiMasker to learn a mask
     # see the MultiPCA code in nilearn. As in the MultiPCA code, mask given in fit can be a niimg or a NiftiMasker, if None, a NiftiMasker is used.

http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/adap_restart_paper.pdf
in particular paragraph 3.2

Basically, it boils down to the fact that resetting the FISTA parameters (t and t0) every once in a while speeds the convergence process. We are already partly doing that by setting 'z = w' in the monotonous FISTA scheme below.

What I would like you to test is the following strategies:
1. if at line 235 we put z=w and t=1, do we get a better convergence (standard log-log plots on fMRI problems)?
2. if, at the line above (line 226) we do the following (mfista_factor being initialized above to eg 1e-2):

``` python
     if energy_delta < mfista_factor * energy:
            mfista_factor *= 1e-2
            ....
```

in other words, loosen the criteria to switch to mFISTA in the beginning of the convergence of the algorithm.
I'd be interested in empirical tests (as usual, standard log-log plots on fMRI data) to see if this speeds things up.

The problem is that you are using the mask_vt, which is a tiny mask. Thus, once you apply feature screening, there is very little left in the mask.

**First action point**

In general, we feel that SpaceNet is best designed for full brain use. Thus you need to change the definition of the masker in the example to:

<pre>
nifti_masker = NiftiMasker(mask_strategy='epi', standardize=True)
</pre>

Once this is done, the results make more sens (I'll post figures when computations are finished).

**Second action point**

Because users will fall in this trap, we need to express the percentile of voxels kept as a volumetric percentile with regards to a full brain. For this:
- I would like you to compute the volume in a standard brain (/usr/share/fsl/data/standard/MNI152_T1_1mm_brain_mask.nii.gz)
- When you are given a mask, in space_net, you should compute it's volume, and use the ratio of the two to adjust the screening percentile.

I would do something like this:

<pre>
idx = np.where(mask)
i_min = max(idx[0].min() -1, 0)
i_max = max(idx[0].max(), mask.shape[0] - 1)

@lesteve a `w` instance would contain a brain image, potentially masked, but I am not sure at this point. So its shape can go from around `(10, 40, 40)` to `(100, 100, 100)`. As for `max_iter`, I am guess a couple of hundreds, but @dohmatob has more experience with that.

1. If no `err_msg` argument is provided, it seems to me that in err_msg the `x` and `y` will be set to the first x and y in the loop rather to the ones that don't satisfy the constraint, potentially yielding to a misleading error message. In other words, I would move this statement in the `if a > b:` block below.

The choice of 42 is arbitrary. To make a check more robust, one might
want to marginalize it.

I disagree. I want the measure to be absolute so that we can set a

Quite on the contrary. With the settings being a percentile of the voxels
(which is basically what you are advocating), when doing ROI-based
analysis, the default give meaningless selections. For instance selecting
40 voxels. This is exactly what happened earlier, and what prompted me to
ask for this specific implementation.

Honestly, please no. Think about it. If people specify a small mask, as
in the Haxby dataset, and leave the default settings (which 90% of the
users will), they will get nonsense. And it's not like it's nonsense that
is easy to diagnose.
