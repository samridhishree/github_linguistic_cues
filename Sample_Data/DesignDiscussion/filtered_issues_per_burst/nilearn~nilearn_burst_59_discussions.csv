One reason to love Codacy even if you have no clue what it does: it rates nilearn as an A project: https://www.codacy.com/app/lesteve/nilearn/dashboard.

About adding the hyphen in front of each line, have you checked how it renders in the html API reference documentation? Personally I wouldn't bother doing that in this PR.
