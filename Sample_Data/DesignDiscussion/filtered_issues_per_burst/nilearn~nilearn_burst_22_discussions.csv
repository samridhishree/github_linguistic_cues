Sorry, I didn't express myself clearly enough. In the attached file, you
will find a short piece of code that reproduces the bug (?):

loading an MSDL image (already binarized) by NiftiMasker results in a
NiftiMasker.mask_img_ that just contains a huge rectangle but not the
original MSDL region (dumped to disk as nii in the example).

I hope my report makes any sense :-) Let me know if I can be of any further
assistance.

I think that we should expose it in the various nifti maskers and
probably enable it by default. SPM has the bad habit of putting NaNs

On my side, I see this: you have a binary mask that you are trying to fit and all you obtain is a big square. I've seen no Nan in your file.
First, you should simply feed the mask directly to the NiftiMasker: NiftiMasker(mask='MSDL_bin_0000.bin')
Second, there is indeed a bug: compute_epi_mask was not made to fit a mask on binary data, althought I think that it should behave well in such a case.

The heuristic to compute the mask is the following: we take the histogram of the image, cut the first and last values, look at the highest gradient in the histogram and take it as a threshold. As your file has a very low number of activated voxels, it is cut in the first step. Fitting the mask on your binary data works if you set mask_upper_cutoff=0.99999 in the NiftiMasker options.

@GaelVaroquaux do you consider it as a bug ? I'm afraid that computing the mask could fail on very sparse fMRI (if only one ROI is aquired for example).

Well, first we can hack compute_epi_mask so that if the array has only 2
values it is well-behaved: take the largest of the two values, issue a
warning, and take the largest cc.

Second, we will need to implement a 'masking_strategy' option to the
masker.

Yes, agreed. We have been discussing add a 'masking_strategy' argument,

I'd rather have it the other way: explicit is better than implicit.

6,issue_comment,82,nilearn,nilearn,pgervais,2013-06-21 08:57:25,"My thoughts on this. 

MultiPCA needs a mask for its computations. The user can provide it or let the object compute it from data. The latter situation can be handled in two ways: either by providing a masker object, or by providing the _options_ taken by the masker object (and let MultiPCA create one). What the user would write is respectively (in extremely simplified form, for the purpose of the example):

```
MultiPCA(smoothing_fwhm=2)
```

or 

```
masker = MultiNiftiMasker(smoothing_fwhm=2)
MultiPCA(mask=masker)
```

The second situation being useful when the same masker (not mask) is to be reused in different places.

The question raised in this issue is what should happen in this situation:

```
masker = MultiNiftiMasker(smoothing_fwhm=2)
MultiPCA(mask=masker, smoothing_fwhm=3)
```

What I think after talking with Alexandre is that this situation must not happen: this is an **error**. The Python langage prevents a keyword argument from being provided twice. Let's do the same. The present example is a conflict, which is ambiguous. Giving priority to either value (that in masker or that provided to MultiPCA itself) is implicit in all cases.

OK, I am +1 for this to be by default, but the way that I would like it
to happen is with bounds computed on the mask, and not computed
automatically from the image... Now, we may need to have a
memory-efficient mask computation routine, but that's needed anyhow.

> This could also be useful for people who inverse_transform large arrays

That would be a surprising behavior: one expects inverse_transform to
behave as close as possible to the inverse of the transform.

What I meant is that, if I plan to inverse_transform large arrays, then I may set the option tight_bounds = True. We should obviously not crop without a request of the user.

In these settings, I am OK with it being by default: I don't see any
adverse consequence.
