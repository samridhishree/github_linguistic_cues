In the reproducing example provided there, the package had a ``__init__.py`` file. We should check where astroid is raising the ImportError in the first place, in order to know what triggers the bug.",nan,nan

2,issue_comment,419,pycqa,astroid,rr-,2017-03-25 07:44:22,"Switching to a slightly more verbose idiom:

```
class Command:
    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        raise NotImplementedError()
```

as well as providing default value:

```
class Command:
    name: str = 'INVALID'
```

works, nonetheless `astroid` shouldn't crash like this.",nan,nan
