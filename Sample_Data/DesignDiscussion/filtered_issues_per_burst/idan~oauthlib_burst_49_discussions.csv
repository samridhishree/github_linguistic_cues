3,issue_comment,432,idan,oauthlib,adamn,2016-11-24 16:14:32,Flask and all currently maintained frameworks support 2.7 and 3.4+ so there's no problem there.  ,nan,nan
4,issue_comment,432,idan,oauthlib,adamn,2016-11-24 16:16:34,"Sorry, didn't understand your statement.  Flask [does still test 2.6 and 3.3](https://github.com/pallets/flask/blob/master/tox.ini) but it really seems unnecessary unless somebody reading this is actually using one of those versions in production and planning on installing new versions of `oauthlib`.  Please comment if that's the case.",nan,nan
