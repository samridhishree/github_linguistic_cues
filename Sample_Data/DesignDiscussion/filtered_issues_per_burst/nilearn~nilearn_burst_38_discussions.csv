I think that in the long run, we should be using more and more pandas datasframes in the example code and for behavioral variables. Indeed, when they are well used, they make the code more readable. Thus to foster adoption this could be something important.

Right now, pandas is a package that has enough adoption and install basis that I feel it is safe to depend on it. Nonetheless we could delay the import to inside the function, so that if pandas is not installed, the whole import of nilearn does not fail.

OK. I just don't like ugly things entering the codebase, so this is why I
am not too excited about having this fixed in a separate PR.

For simple things it is easier. Also, I mention this to replace a
recarray. Recarrays are tricky to manipulate.

But, actually, for me it is hard to judge without a usage example, and I
am a bit puzzled that this PR doesn't make use of the corresponding
feature in an example

If recarrays are tricky, then pandas dataframe are intricate. For example, a simple join makes the index column disappear and one has to call `reset_index` to get it back. I am not against using DataFrame in our functions but I think we should always expose recarrays to the user.

OK, let's go with merging this guy, but this is really not how we work.
We need to be always example driven in order to make the right choices
for the APIs. Here, it is especially important, as there is no equivalent
dataset included: we are introducing a new type of information, so we
need to know how to organize it.

Actually, it does so for a bad reason: it has not been centered, hence it competes with the intercept to fit the mean signal in the data...
If  you want to make this example meaningful, center the covariate and test it instead of testing the intercept.

Moreover, I think that there should be 2 examples instead of that one:
- one ""data example"", that shows how to use the localizer dataset, with simple methodology (classical t-test, no permutations)
- one ""methods example"", that compares permuted OLS with standard OLS. (and then other examples for RPBI, robust regression etc.)
