Hi there,

Any updates on that issue?

We use sqlalchemy extensively so that false positive shows up a lot.

Because we use it so much, we can not just do an inline disable, nor do we want to disable the ''no-value-for-parameter"" globally. 

So our current solution for the time being is to wrap pylint into a simple script that just filter out the ""No value passed for parameter 'dml' in function call"" lines, which kind of sucks and make our ""pylinter"" more complicated to use.

Using that wrapper is not ideal and it would be awesome if:
1) pylint/astroid would properly handle the sqlalchemy.Table.insert() calls, or
2) provide an easy way to just ignore those specific errors.

I know 1 may not be easy so maybe 2 is a more realistic solution? I am not aware of anyway to specifically ignore this error. I tried ignored-modules=sqlalchemy or ignored-classes=sqlalchemy.sql.schema.Table but it does not mute that error.

I think in general having more granularity around ignores at the pylintrc level is a good thing when encountering those issues.

Any suggestions?

PS: Thanks a lot for that awesome tool!

This will most likely be fixed when this PR will be integrated: https://bitbucket.org/logilab/pylint/pull-request/222/added-support-for-arity-decrementing/diff. It adds support for understanding arity decrementing decorators and this issue falls in the same situation.

For a work-around to fix the errors on Python 2, I've submitted this pull request: https://bitbucket.org/logilab/astroid/pull-request/70/work-around-the-python-2-part-of-issue

I frequently get people asking me why they're seeing errors while installing my software so I'd really like to see this fixed!

Would you like to work on a patch? ;-) It would be nice to have this fixed, but I'm at this point in a dearth of time, being overwhelmed by the number of issues that needs to be solved.
