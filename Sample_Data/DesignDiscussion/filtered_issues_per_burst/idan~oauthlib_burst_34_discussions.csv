Although this project doesn't seem to be affected, it would still be good idea to require >= 1.0.0 instead.

I see cryptography being installed but never imported / explicitly used. I'm guessing pyjwt does not install this implicitly and we have do it?

Summary:
This current version happens to replace #226, and accidentally includes #336 (which is minor).
