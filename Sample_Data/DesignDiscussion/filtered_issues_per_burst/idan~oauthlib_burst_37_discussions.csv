Wouldn't it be better to return an empty list?

The Oauth2 may not return a scope in the response if it didn't change which scope was requested. More info on #306 as well. 

I am not sure why but another person I know using Google + flask-oauthlib doesn't get this error but I can create it 100% of the time.

If you're stuck and don't have the luxury of waiting on a release, you can host the compliance fixes in your own code.
