Does it mean that those unittests are never executed in the CI (because tox env doesn't install numpy)?",nan,nan
5,issue_comment,461,pycqa,astroid,PCManticore,2017-11-11 11:39:01,@hippo91 apparently that's true! https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/blob/7bfb5e83b162d2126c9929b6d863724176269b6d/tox.ini#L14 we weren't installing numpy for pypy and py3.3,nan,nan
6,issue_comment,461,pycqa,astroid,PCManticore,2017-11-11 11:39:50,Merged since the missing numpy doesn't block this PR. We'll handle this in its own change.,nan,nan
