by changing `auto_reconnect`'s value you would, basically, get different interface -- `execute` would become coroutine
and, for example, pipe-lineing would work as easy is it does now

when redis server is down this would stuck for some time
so we won't be able to control connection timeout (as we can do with `wait_for(create_redis(...), 5)`)

Can you remove `auto_reconnect` argument and add `create_reconnecting_redis` coroutine instead?
This would make me happy) And you can continue with tests and docs so I can merge this PR

``` python
