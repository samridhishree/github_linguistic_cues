Document `coef_` as:

- `(n_classes, n_features)` for `n_classes > 2`, and
- `(n_features,)` for regression

- `alpha_grids_` doc missing
- `best_model_params_` doc missing and format list(list()) to be changed to ndarray
- `alpha_` is no longer an attribute
- `all_coef_ , classes_ , coef_img_ , mask_ , memory_ , n_classes_ , w_ , ymean_ , Xmean_ , Xstd_` attributes are missing
