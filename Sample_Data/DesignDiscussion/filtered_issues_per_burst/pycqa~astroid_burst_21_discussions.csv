I can't replicate this failure.  Can you give us some more information about what conditions you're seeing the failure under?

Okay, the original report happened when running pytest.

Using the new unittest way I see

```
#!python

python -m unittest discover -p ""unittest*.py"" --verbose
....
test_from_imports (astroid.tests.unittest_brain.SixBrainTest) ... FAIL

The whole thing is when I am running the test suite during installation on a Gentoo Linux system.

Can you check that six is installed correctly for the Python interpreter you're using?  If it is, try running:

``` python
from six.moves import http_client
http_client.HTTPSConnection
```

and describe what happens.

PyPy tests should be clean as of b68ee1186e5f.

Python.NET is IronPython or it's different? I will be happy to assist you on a PR, but first I got to see why it fails. ;-)

No, [Python.NET](http://pythonnet.github.io/) is a library to import and use CLR assemblies like Python modules.

I don't know yet what the exact loading mechanism is, it's not exposed to Python, but it allows you to do stuff like `from System import String` to use .NET classes.

Probably we could fix this by adding AST transforms. Have a look at astroid.brain, there's a bunch of transforms that could be useful for inspiration. Adding support for this in modutils doesn't seem the right approach.

I don't have a particular interest in Python .NET, but I would be happy to help anyone that wants to tackle this issue, by implementing transforms or other changes required for astroid to work on this platform, but there is no point, for now, to keep this issue opened if there is no interest in supporting it by the core.
