This is just a warning.

The latest nilearn are compatible with scipy 0.18.

It would be good if we could try to be as close as possible to the structure of the other atlases that we are downloading. In particular, it would be good if the maps that are most likely to be used would be in a key called ""maps"", as in the other atlases, and the labels in a list given the corresponding labels in the order of the maps. You would have to give names to maps, rather than networks, but that should be easy, for instance ""Default-Mode_50"", .... You would need to add a list of networks labels too. The names of the other maps could then use a similar terminology, such as ""unthresh_maps"""", and ""networks_maps"".

No, not when 0.18 is installed. We need to make an adaption layer.

<pre>
n_refinements = 3

cv = (i**2 for i in range(5))

import itertools

# Use itertools.tee to duplicate multiple times the cv iterator
for this_cv in itertools.tee(cv, n_refinements):
    print(list(this_cv))
</pre>

And then you can use the cv object just as before.",378ed738ead5b965be2fe5b9c1e166fb5d4708bf,"(None, '', u'nilearn/connectome/group_sparse_cov.py')"
