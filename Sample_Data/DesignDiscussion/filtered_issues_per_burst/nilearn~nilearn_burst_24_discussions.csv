Showing the output before the code is not illogic : we show the figures before the code, which is part of the output of the script. However, I agree that such a long output should not be shown. We should first reduce the verbosity of the objects. Second, I think that these debug output are done on stderr, not on stdout. We should not capture stdout, but it has to be verified.
