And `setup_requires` is not a solution that works reliably for older versions of setuptools either.

And setuptools downgrading to 1.1.6 on travis is not something I have seen before, and should be considered a bug somewhere else (not astroid).  It might be another case of #4194 (which I have only glanced at, so I might be off base there).
