Mask is better. It makes it more explicite that a mask can be passed in.
Passing in a masker concerns only a small fraction of power users. These
can read the docs.

For internals, we need components_ (for instance to get MultiPCA to talk
to ICA, or for the transform), so I am +1 to keep components_ rather than
components_img_

We should instruct people to use

How about short-circuiting this object and using it's internals rather
than the full object (i.e. a function that does the work rather than the

Not memorizing it: it is fast to compute and not worth the speed/time

I'd rather have it the other way: explicit is better than implicit.
",nan,nan
6,issue_comment,82,nilearn,nilearn,pgervais,2013-06-21 08:57:25,"My thoughts on this. 

MultiPCA needs a mask for its computations. The user can provide it or let the object compute it from data. The latter situation can be handled in two ways: either by providing a masker object, or by providing the _options_ taken by the masker object (and let MultiPCA create one). What the user would write is respectively (in extremely simplified form, for the purpose of the example):

```
MultiPCA(smoothing_fwhm=2)
```

or 

```
masker = MultiNiftiMasker(smoothing_fwhm=2)
MultiPCA(mask=masker)
```

The second situation being useful when the same masker (not mask) is to be reused in different places.

The question raised in this issue is what should happen in this situation:

```
masker = MultiNiftiMasker(smoothing_fwhm=2)
MultiPCA(mask=masker, smoothing_fwhm=3)
```

What I think after talking with Alexandre is that this situation must not happen: this is an **error**. The Python langage prevents a keyword argument from being provided twice. Let's do the same. The present example is a conflict, which is ambiguous. Giving priority to either value (that in masker or that provided to MultiPCA itself) is implicit in all cases.
