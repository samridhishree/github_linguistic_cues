Those examples was intended to demonstrate the way to work with pub/sub;

> `asyncio.async` is depreciated in favour of `asyncio.ensure_future`

This is true for Python 3.4.4+. This is a bit harder to change 'cause `aioredis` claims to support Python 3.3

> async_reader2 is defined by never use, i guess the last line should be using it.

And again, it's just to demonstrate an idea.

I'm pretty sure the last line has a typo and should be referencing `async_reader2`.

A link to the example would be good but for me the code in the docs is more confusing than helpful, why not just replace it with the example?
