2,issue_comment,136,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-04-18 20:40:56,"The difference here is the asynchronicity of the authorization code grant. The user authorization is captured in an authorization code. When the code is later exchanged for a token there is no way for the provider to know which user it is meant to associate the new token with unless it previously bound a user to the authorization code. All other core grant types obtain a token in a synchronous flow.

The check for user is just to help remind developers of this and provide a simple way to pass a long a user to later be available in the save_bearer_token call. If you don't associate a token with a user there is not much point of having oauth tokens since the requests later will only specify token, never user.

Not sure if that helped, let me know =)

3,issue_comment,136,idan,oauthlib,taestone,2013-04-19 09:25:08,"thanks for comment.

I was confused because In django model, It save user_id in authcode(information about responsed authcode db) and bearer_token temporarily . For verification check with authorization code and bearer token, It seems to need for provider to have to save the both. It makes that the provider can be aware of the user who confirmed the permission. Is it just for django implementation and not common other implementation?

In resource access, it's seem for client know the user.
When accessing protected resource, the client has to know the user whose  resource it request.
",nan,nan
4,issue_comment,136,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-04-22 15:21:14,"Yes, the authorization code is only meant to exist temporarily and hold the authorization/permission the user gives and which user it was, among other things. This is not specific to Django but serves as an example of what needs to be done. Exactly how is up to the developer.

[This drawing from the OAuth 2 spec](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1) might help to clarify what is going on. This is quite similar to OAuth 1, but without the request signing.

What is happening is that the user is given an authorization code, which it carries over to the client through a redirection. This code is then exchanged for a token. The only way the provider can know which user this token should belong to is by looking it up from the authorization code. Thus we need to store user twice.

Regarding moving to RFC it certainly is time and I've only put it off because moving files around is boring and that OAuth 2 is split over so many more RFCs than just the core. For the sake of keeping with consistency we might want to split the draft25 folder into several RFC folders, Bearer, Core, MAC etc but not sure if that will just confuse things.

Our goal is to provide a simple Django app that helps developer to add oauth2 and oauth1 support in their projects. We use oauthlib in the backend of course!

- oauth2 provider supporting all the standard workflows
- oauth2 client facilities

I've not done very much yet, only begun yesterday and most time was spent

about django and see if it caught any traction but we should definitely see
if we can merge our work. Fancy dropping into irc? #oauthlib on freenode.

My current plan is along the lines of:
- Add a number of convenience methods to common.Request to facilitate parameter finding for grant_types
- Sort out resource endpoint error reporting and go over authorization and token endpoint error reporting and make sure it mimics the spec and my plans
- Bearer token token_type estimation
- Weed out the most broken bits of the endpoints and grant types by implementing extensive endpoint tests
- Play around with making a basic but fully functional oauth provider with Django or Flask to find any missing features, annoyances and see if the API is at level of usability I'm happy with
- Write some docs ;)
- MAC, JWT, SAML token support
- More docs ;)

tell me more about Django basic oauth provider. How can I help you?
I'm interested in oauth 2 for Installed applications like described at google documentation [1].

I think that a good starting point is to learn how google do it and start write some 
Django views that mimics the google way of do things. I mean a Django app or view to register your application,
branding information and get your generated clients ID like google api console [2]. It can be a django admin page
for now.

What do you think?

I have many ideas for a django-oauth extension but afraid I won't be able to get to it before the summer. It's a good idea to have a look at the Google API Console and spend time streamlining the processes around registering and maintaining clients. Essentially such an extension could boil, if done right, reduce the complexity of authorizing api use with OAuth down to a simple decorator. Now that is the future, for now I'll focus on getting the OAuth 2 support in oauthlib working, spec compliant and well tested.

tox is not yet available in Debian or Ubuntu.  Yes, I am actively working on
that :).

In Ubuntu it is fairly straightforward to get multiple python versions running, although mentioning step by step would be helpful. I've not looked into running multiple python versions in other OSs so hoping some unsung hero of the internets will come to the rescue =)

Yes, please!  There are very good reasons to want to use oauthlib without
requests, e.g. as a straight up replacement for the long abandoned oauth.  In
fact, a little user guide for converting from oauth to oauthlib would be
fantastic.  It's not a difficult conversion, although it's a bit of a brain
twister at first because of the different terminology.

Sorry, my stack is too deep at the moment to contribute such documentation,
but if pressed I could probably dig up a diff.

Then I could simply port that over and show how in the docs.

Is it http://pypi.python.org/pypi/oauth/1.0.1 ?

Yep.  Notice the Uploaded date :)

Okay, piston-mini-client is one package I'm working on.  This is not fully
tested yet (note the as yet unported PLAINTEXT signature method), but it
should give you an idea of what I had to change to do the conversion.  Once I
get this working, I might even submit a more detailed blurb for the
documentation.

Will add imports of the constants in oauthlib.oauth1.**init**.py tomorrow so you can omit ""rfc4849"". If you are interested in RSA-SHA1 signatures have a look at https://gist.github.com/2584789
