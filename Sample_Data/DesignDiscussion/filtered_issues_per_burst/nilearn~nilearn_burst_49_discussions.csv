Basically, we just have to do a PR to increment a version number in the yaml recipe file.

I would like to know if there is any benefit in using conda-forge. If not, we may advertise not to use it as we do not control the diffusion. If, during a tutorial, somebody uses anaconda to install nilearn and does not have the right version, I can't imagine what will happen if he uses pip on top of that to upgrade it.

dangerous). Please discuss this with @ogrisel. I'll trust whatever

OK for the general idea, but I'd rather avoid injecting variable in the
global/local namespaces. It's bad practice.

I'd rather have somethig like (adapted from
http://stackoverflow.com/a/437857/413856):

version_dict = {}
exec(open('nilearn/version.py').read(), version_dict, version_dict)

and then fish the version variable from version_dict.

- `plot_stat_map` is designed to plot statistical maps and plot them nicely, with useful defaults.
- Anybody who wants to do anything that differs from what is proposed in `plot_stat_map` should use `plot_img`
- An enhancement of `plot_stat_map` would be to add a keyword argument `symmetric_range=True`, which if specified to `False` will make the colorbar go from 0 to the positives.

We could also have defined the dependencies in setup.py. The thing is that for example numpy needs to be compiled from source when using pip install. This compilation step is likely to fail (for example because you don't have the package with the required C headers on Linux, or even more likely on Windows where most of our users don't have any C compiler installed) 

Basically we are strongly encouraging users to install numpy, scipy and scikit-learn via their OS package managers on Linux or Anaconda on Windows and OSX.

Not much to add to what you said. That said, we should note that since
the alpha release, we have added the nibabel dependency in the

Maybe shooting a warning (or an error) in the setup.py would be a good
way to do this.

To do this, we should probably move the '_check_dependencies' out from
nilearn/__init__.py to nilearn.version and 'import' it in the setup.py as
the version number is currently imported.

I think that we would accept a PR (pull request) doing that.
Unfortunately, I'll be offline for 2 weeks starting tomorrow. So I cannot
review it, but maybe other people of the nilearn team will be able to.

I think the general idea has legs but needs to be tweaked a bit. The caveat is that you don't want to throw when nibabel is not installed in setup.py because setup.py is supposed to install it.

Also it'd be good to check what setup.py install error exactly looks like, to make sure we get an error that is actually helpful.

Good point. That means that you probably need to have a keyword argument
in the dependency checker.

Also, we should raise an error only if an install is asked, and not other
options.

1e-15 is for numerical instability. 1e-5 is because some algorithms do

I think that the code was correct. The goal of this code is to say that

not displayed. The main usecase is to threshold a O, in which case, you
want to set transparent {0} and not the null ensemble.

Now I think that it comes back to me (I wrote this code, but years ago; I
do remember that this detail was important) suppose that you have a
binary image, only zeros and 1. You don't want 1 to be masked, even if
there are more than 20% of 1. I think that this is the usecase that the

OK. I think that you are right and I am wrong. Is it possible to write a

Hum, could it be that the NiftiMasker standardizes on all the data,
whereas we would really like to standardize only on the time points used
for learning? Could you check this (for instance by using scikit-learn's
standardizer only on the selected time points?

In which case, it is really an argument for:
- The Decoder object that @schwarty and Andres are working on (it can
  solve the problem by doing the standardization for the user)
- Having a selection vector to select time points in the NiftiMasker

I would say: add a base class, and inherit from it in the OrthoSlicer,
where you add methods, and in your own projector, where you add different

But it's not a method. An object is more than a namespace of methods. It
has an internal state and methods act on its internal state. That's why
reading code that is object-oriented is harder to read: you never know
what has changed and what has not.

Thus, I would really push for using functions rather than staticmethods.

I would agree using only functions glass_brain.py is simpler. Having the glass brain plotting as part of the Axes makes sense but you need to jump through a few more levels (the `**kwargs` I added to a few methods [recently](https://github.com/lesteve/nilearn/commit/9909e211752197a844a18dd26043eb6792b8a5e0)). Other than that, there are still coord (axes level) and cut_coords (display level) in a few places in slicers.py which is a bit awkward given that it doesn't really apply to the glass brain use case.

I am worried that the default setting look pretty bad. Could you replace
the colormap by an alpha one, to see how things look like. We would need
things to be good by default, and right now it is not the case. My
suggestion would be to use a transparent colorbar starting fully
transparant at the threshold, and becoming fully non transparent at the
max value.

Yes, and that's quite clearly a problem. I am afraid that the colormap
setting might also be wrong, which would explain the saturation effect
that I have the impression that I am seeing in the figures above.

From a quick look at the [code](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/plotting/cm.py#L94), the alpha goes from 0.5 to 1. They may be a reason for that though.

It doesn't suit our purposes. You should probably add an extra argument
to the colormap-generating function to control the lower value for alpha,
and set it to 0 in the case of the glass-brain.

The second thing is that on the black bg, we should probably have a colormap going to black (which tells us that the argument that we take should maybe be a color, not a colormap, and we would generate the corresponding colormap.

I think it does, there are a few very negative values in the eyes that survive the max along an axis.

> The second thing is that on the black bg, we should probably have a colormap going to black (which tells us that the argument that we take should maybe be a color, not a colormap, and we would generate the corresponding colormap.

We could have the cmap default to None and then do the logic in plot_glass_brain to switch between the white and black background. The white background would have a colormap going from white to red and the black one a colormap going from black to red.

> I think that we should apply it on the raw maps, and then project, as this is what a user would want to do when visualizing a statistical map: do not display any voxel that has too small a statistic.

I believe that's what we are doing at the moment. That would explain why you see some white pixels (e.g. top left or bottom left) with the threshold=10 which are not here with the default threshold. The threshold removes small positive values and you are left with the more extreme negative ones. 

One last comment, the data is actually contrast data, I am wondering whether it would be worth calculating p-values like this [example](http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/plot_localizer_simple_analysis.html#example-plot-localizer-simple-analysis-py) to have a more realistic use case.

Ah, OK. Shouldn't we be taking the absolutely value before summing?

That's an option. It's simple and would do the trick. Let's go for this.

I went back on forth on this one, that's what I did naively at first but I got convinced by @bthirion to only take the max (something related to the fact that you can easily transformation t-tests into F-test and that the latter only has only positive values). Also as a side comment, note we are not summing but taking the max along an axis.

> These are T maps? If they are T maps, that's a pretty good example of standard usecase.

I think we are using the contrasts via `datasets.get_localizer_contrasts`. I hadn't seen until now that you could get t_maps by setting `get_tmaps=True` in this function. I'll try that.

If you look at the last figure posted by @lesteve, on the left column (black background) you can see in the first subplot (the yellow one) that they gray ""internal"" lines are very contrasted while the white ""external"" lines are not visible. On the contrary, when the plot is mainly red (just below) the white lines are visible but not the gray ones. I think that the problem here is that the color of the lines should not depend on the background color, but on the context of the line.

I don't think that matplotlib allows complex overlays of images. And it is technically doable but it would require some dirty code. But it may be good enough for the users to allow a custom value for these colors.

I don't think there it too much of a risk of conflict between the two PRs. @eickenberg is changing plot_stat_map in img_plotting.py and aims at changing the cmap before doing the imshow. @banilo is changing stuff mostly in slicers.py and doesn't change the cmap before the imshow but only when the colorbar is displayed.

No. An converged algorithm (for l1 penalties) typically gives non-zero
coeffs where they are zero in practice. 1e-6 is a good compromise,
because most often values that should not be zeros are above that, and
sparse algorithms converge below that.

I kind of agree on this one. I think the grayed cmap logic has to handle this case.

> Similarly, I don't see immediately why negative thresholds are forbidden (maybe I'm missing some context here).

At the moment, the treshold logic is such that values in [-threshold, threshold] are masked so it doesn't make too much sense to have a negative threshold (full disclosure: currently it may well be the case that `threshold=-threshold` works exactly the same as `threshold=threshold` by accident)

1. Outside of _utils always use _img. In order to avoid ambiguities I am sincerely hoping that all the user-facing functions always accept Nifti-like images via calling _utils.check_img et al.
2. Inside _utils, make the difference between
   - _img: an object that has get_data and get_affine
   - _niimg: either a Nifti filename or an _img

So to take a few realistic examples:

``` python
# plotting/img_plotting.py

def plot_img(img):
    ""are we fine with the check_niimg(img) inconsistency here""
    img = check_niimg(img)  
    # rest of the code

Concerning the initial Localizer 94 data, the only _mask_ file I am able to find is `mask.nii.gz`.

Concerning the code that generates the ZIP file on the Brainomics server, I recall [version 0.4.5 of module _brainomics_](http://hg.logilab.org/review/cubes/brainomics/rev/1943ec3fcebc) is being used. Specifically have a look at `views/download.py`. Unfortunately bowsing the source code on the above server is currently broken and I don't have the time to fetch the code and have a look at it on my machine.

I don' t have access to the server either. I would have to sit down with one of the sysadmins and examine the issue. It would take to much time to organize.

I suggest you stick to `boolean_mask_mask.nii.gz` - the current behavior. It shouldn't change because the server is fozen. If it ever does, please come back to me and I will investigate.

I agree with most of your analysis. In believe that in general, functions
and variable names should end with ""_img"". However, there is one thing
that we have in nilearn: we call 'niimage', and not 'img', or 'image' the
type ""NiftiImage-like, or string pointing to a nifti file"". Thus I
believe that check_niims, check_niimg, repr_niimgs should stay with
niimg, because they are about dealing with this specific type.

Aside from that, I would say that a PR is most welcome, as ideally we

Is the former an object which has get_data and get_affine whereas the latter can also be a filename and may have some NiftiImage specific properties.

Also, `nilearn.plotting.plot_img` is calling `check_niimg`so it accepts a NiftiImage-like object. Does that mean it should be called `plot_niimg` instead? This is probably not the only example as check_niimg(s) is used quite a bit.

I think that explicit is better than implicit. More importantly, I want
to make it easy for people to use different colormaps.

Then you would set ""symmetric_range"" to False (and we need to point to
that in the docstring of the cmap argument).

I don't understand this, the auto-setting of the colormap would only happen when cmap is left to its default (i.e. None). If the cmap is specified then you left it unmodified.

I don't know it still feels less than great to have to specify two separate arguments when you just want a different colormap.

Saving is forced by passing a filename. `img_plotting._plot_img_with_bg` saves the file if a filename is provided and returns `None` instead of the active display object. Changing the colorbar a posteriori in `plot_stat_map` by interacting with the display object is thus impossible and raises an error.

Two possibilities for solving this:
- add `cbar_min`, `cbar_max` kwargs to `_plot_img_with_bg`, making colorbar range editing available to a wider number of functions (is this wanted at all?)
- do the saving by hand in `plot_stat_map` after the colorbar has been rendered.

Neither of the possibilities poses much of a problem. It is more a question of whether specifying `cbar_max` and `cbar_min` independently of `vmax, vmin` is generally useful or not.

I'd be in favor of this solution even if the colorbar tweaking is only used in plot_stat_map. In my mind _plot_img_with_bg is the generic helper function that user-facing functions call with different parameters.

An other option would be to add a callback that is called with the display as argument just before the save. Not sure which one is simpler.

This sounds about right to me. _plot_img_with_bg is somewhat of a
low-level swiss-army knife, and can thus be made more versatile.

> The bug was mainly due to the fact that the shape of the session mask was not checked. I think that the main advantage is to be able to apply a condition mask to the data without having to load them manually (and still delegate that to the NiftiMasker).

However, given that this is only used for transform, shouldn't it be a parameter for the transform function rather than for the Masker in general?

Possible. The real argument is that it's data dependent (ie has a shape
in n_samples) thus giving it at build-time break cross validation.

Which tells us that sessions shouldn't be given at build time :$

The indexing/slicing PR does make things much easier. However, suppose
that you want, eg to remove the 3 first volumes. With Danilo's PR, it is
trivial to do this in a pipeline, in distributed computing. Manually
using slicing would require more work.

However, the slicing PR should be merged, and then this PR updated to use
it.

If Loic's slicing PR permits slices into memmapped .nii files, then that is the best possible way of saving memory.

So the sole advantage of having time slicing (once Loic's is merged) in the NiftiMasker is the fact that it can go in a pipeline.

We need to make a choice. Too many options are detrimental. It should
probably be 'pre application', because these are the only semantics that
make sens in general. However, this will blend a bit the masked data with
the non masked data in the case of time filtering, so we will have to
warn the user.

Indeed, in a GLM, but we have typically done decoding directly on the data.

My point is that one could use the ""Time Masker"" to mask conditions here. However, since these data are still temporally structured, the example is bad. If you consider a dataset consisting of many beta maps (such as an event-related paradigm), the is nothing time-related at all involved, but one may still be tempted to use the ""Time Masking"" to select images according to certain conditions.

Hence my proposition to use a name that is more general than the word ""time"", e.g. ""sample"". That said, I have no problem using something that has the name ""time"" in it on my non-temporal 4th axis.
