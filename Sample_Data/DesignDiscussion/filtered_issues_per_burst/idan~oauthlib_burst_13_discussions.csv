5,issue_comment,76,idan,oauthlib,sigmavirus24,2013-02-18 18:40:42,"@ib-lundgren you're correct that they stopped supporting 3.1 and now only support 3.2 and 3.3. If you want I can write something for you that will manage the dependencies based on python version, but you'll have to use `python setup.py install` for the install command, not `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2,issue_comment,119,idan,oauthlib,wiliamsouza,2013-02-18 19:40:25,"""How to get started on an OAuth 2 provider"" That is a good question in nutshell It can be basicaly, I implement the methods  of oauthlib.oauth2.RequestValidator and pass it to oauthlib.oauth2.WebApplicationServer so I can call create_authorization_response and  create_token_response?

3,issue_comment,119,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-02-18 20:03:32,"Essentially. yes. Note that while OAuth 2 providers are quickly maturing they are still not quite ready for prime time and there might lurk nasty bugs there.

Check out https://oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/server2.html for some info as well.
