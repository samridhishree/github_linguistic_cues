You can customize the background image used for regular plotting functions. For `plot_glass_brain`, the background template can be customized but it is not trivial for the moment.

What do you need exactly ?

Glass Brain was made by hand. Take a look at

nilearn/nilearn/plotting/glass_brain_files/*.svg

You will see that there are three vector drawings. If you can create these
for the main gyri/sulci of the mouse brain, you can have a mouse glass
brain.

So it depends on how much effort you want to put into it.

cut_coords : None, a tuple of floats, or an integer
            The MNI coordinates of the point where the cut is performed
            If display_mode is 'ortho', this should be a 3-tuple: (x, y, z)
            For display_mode == 'x', 'y', or 'z', then these are the
            coordinates of each cut in the corresponding direction.
            If None is given, the cuts is calculated automaticaly.
            If display_mode is 'x', 'y' or 'z', cut_coords can be an integer,
            in which case it specifies the number of cuts to perform

If _cut_coords_ is a scalar (as in your example), then it's expected to be
and integer representing the number of cuts you want. We can't do the
coercing automatically, as this would run into conflicts with the rest of
the logic. The error you're getting is because the 0 you passed for
_cut_coords_ is being interpreted as number of slices (_n_cuts_ in your
traceback), leading to a zero-division. The latter tells us there is a
stealth bug in the _find_cuts_ function: it should sanitize the value
_n_cuts_ param and throw a meaningful error in case invalid (for example,
in case it's _0_).

``` python
from nilearn._utils import niimg_conversions
niimg_conversions.check_niimg('this_file_does_not_exist')  # error with please set global constants EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS to False

import nilearn
nilearn.EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS = False
niimg_conversions.check_niimg('this_file_does_not_exist')  # still the same error as previously

Also I am a bit confused about EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS functionality. Why don't we want to always use `EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS = True` ?

Good point I missed that. Looking at your tests a little bit more I think we should be testing 3d data too.

If you only have test.nii which is a 3d image in the current working directory, you expect.

``` python
 # 3d image
check_niimg('test.nii')
 # 4d image with last dimension 1 i.e. it is equivalent to check_niimg(['test.nii'])
check_niimg('test*.nii')

A couple of tips:
- double underscore does emphasis (aka bold) in markdown so you want to use backquotes to escape them, see this [link](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for more details.
- using Fix #number in a PR description does automatically close the issue #number once the PR is merged

More than skip tests, you cannot import it at all windows, I suspect.
Which means that importing scikit-learn on windows would crash.

We need CI for Windows. I created an issue: #804.

You put a smaller object but didn't change the memory_limit. I would guess that's why the Travis tests are now failing.

I haven't double-checked the memory usage computation but it looks like the Travis failure is due to the fact that the memory usage doesn't go over the memory_limit threshold.

This is a possibility but I would be surprised as the maximum memory is set to 10000000 (10MB) and the size of the array is 12MB which is not that much.

Maybe using a strategy based on MemoryProfiler would help.

Indeed, under old versions of Python, there were segfaults when you asked
for too much memory.

This is fine with me. It would be great to find a few tests to add in order to test functions in nilearn where  memory consumption actually matters. @AlexandreAbraham, @GaelVaroquaux any suggestions ?

But we don't use older versions of Python. This is why this seems strange to me.

Yes, I know how to do it with `memory_profiler`. The goal of this PR was to rely on the system and avoid a dependency.

Any function that is supposed to treat data iteratively such as `compute_multi_epi_mask` (or `multi_compute_epi_mask` or `compute_epi_multi_mask`).
