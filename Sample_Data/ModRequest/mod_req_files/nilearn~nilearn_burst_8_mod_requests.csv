issue_comment,NA,NA,45,GaelVaroquaux,2013-04-18 08:19:16,"Imports should be from general to specific. Thus sklearn comes after scipy.

Naming conventions: n_confounds rather then confound_number

In docstrings, we usually say ""array-like"", rather than ""numpy.ndarray"", as other objects should work.

The return section is not correctly formatted. It won't build the docs right.

The remark on ordering faster is true only for numpy belove 1.7. Anyhow, I would try doing something like:

var = np.copy(series)
var **= 2
var = var.sum(axis=0)

I believe that this should always be fast (not tested, please correct me if I am wrong).

""Most energetic"" -> largest

thanks for the PR!
