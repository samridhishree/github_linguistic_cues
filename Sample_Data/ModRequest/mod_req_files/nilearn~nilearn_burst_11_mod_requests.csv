Still, I agree on the fact that the name is confusing. I made a proposal at the very beginning of this thread that nobody commented on: adding an option to apply_mask() to distinguish between the regions and fMRI data cases. That would be a way to get rid of apply_mask_to_regions().

Another way to get it out of the way would be to change the signature of apply_regions(), and to make it take non-masked input. I think we'll hit performance issues by doing this, that's why I didn't go for this solution.

Yes. That's why we are not going to use them in nisl. However, in
scikit-learn, we need them.

I hadn't realized that you we talking about this function. I don't think
that such a function should exist in the public API. I does not serve a
usecase that people commonly need and will confuse people.

I understand your point of view on regions masking, and that keeping the labels after masking could be useful. However, integrating this in apply_mask_to_regions() would lead to an inconsistent API imo. The output of apply_mask_to_regions() is designed to be used as input to apply_regions(), nothing else in the present state.

I used the word ""unapply"" to get a consistent pair of function names (apply_mask / unmask being not consistent enough for me). I'm aware that this may not be the best names ever, particularly because these functions are not exact inverse to each other. Any other ideas (including other arguments against the existence of (un)apply_mask_regions) are welcome!
