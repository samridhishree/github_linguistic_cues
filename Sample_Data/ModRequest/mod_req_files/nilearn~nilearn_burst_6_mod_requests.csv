pull_request_commit_comment,NA,NA,38,AlexandreAbraham,2012-12-03 08:14:01,"Yes, and I'm not really honest in the error message because, if high_pass > low_pass, you don't end up with a blank signal but with some weird values full of NaNs which, in my sense, is worse. That's why it's really an error and not a warning.

pull_request_commit_comment,NA,NA,38,GaelVaroquaux,2012-11-30 16:46:02,"I think that we should modify the butterworth function to accept (optionally) a 2D array, and do this loop inside the function. It would enable factorizing the filter creation code.

pull_request_commit_comment,NA,NA,38,AlexandreAbraham,2012-11-29 14:23:26,"In case one asks, I changed the default value of low_pass and high_pass from False to None because it causes me trouble when testing butterworth filter. In fact, I've put these parameters as None by default in the butterworth function and, as they were passed as ""False"", they were considered as 0 and bugs raised.

I've changed it to None to avoid this bug in the future.
