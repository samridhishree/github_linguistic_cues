These are T maps? If they are T maps, that's a pretty good example of
standard usecase.

Ah, OK. Shouldn't we be taking the absolutely value before summing?

That's an option. It's simple and would do the trick. Let's go for this.

Agreed for the utils, but I don't want to invest time in something like a
library that is of no use to us. People are welcome to take the code and
make it a library.
