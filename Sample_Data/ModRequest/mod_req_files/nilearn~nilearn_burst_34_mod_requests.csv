No, it often comes from nowhere. For instance you want to work on a voxel
size of (3 x 3 x 4), eg to reduce your dataset. You don't care about the
offset, you just want to specify the voxel size.

Another tricky thing that comes to my mind is the following: Assume you want to transform image 1 to the space of image 2 and you decide that you would like a minimal bounding box around image 1. The question now is, intuitively, would you want the newly calculated translation vector to respect the voxel space (ie the discretisation grid) of image 2? In this case you need the translation vector and the bounding box will lie within a voxel of the optimal bounding box which disrespects the voxel space.
