Surely this can't be true, 'autodoc-process-docstring' doesn't know anything about example files which are sphinxgallery specific. The only way this can work if the autodoc-process-string creates all example files as empty and then sphinxgallery comes along, parses the example scripts and overrides the .examples files.

Yes the ordering is guaranteed. As each one is assigned a different event in the sphinx build. It does not depend in the ordering of the extensions in conf.py but to which build step it was assigned. Sphinx-gallery happens when the builder is started(outputs rst files, image files, .example files), but the autodoc file touch is when rst files are parsed.
So autodoc is completely independent of sphinx-gallery, it only tries to include a matching example file to every module it has to document. If it can't find the file a warning is issued, and in our case the missing file is touched and so no warning issued.

Yes, I agree on the redundancy. At some point I tested to rename it to sphx_glr_auto_example_ or to remove completely the example_ prefix, but I could not agree with myself on which to prefer so I left it that way. I support the fact to have the full target name on the reference starting from the sphinx source folder, so to our convention the gallery sits in auto_examples_. That way is was easier to link to the images and references.

Sphinx gallery does its job first creating the .example files. 'autodoc-process-docstring' is executed afterwards everytime it finds the include directive to the example file

> That makes the naming a bit too redundant: example_auto_examples_

Yes, I agree on the redundancy. At some point I tested to rename it to sphx_glr_auto_example_ or to remove completely the example_ prefix, but I could not agree with myself on which to prefer so I left it that way. I support the fact to have the full target name on the reference starting from the sphinx source folder, so to our convention the gallery sits in auto_examples_. That way is was easier to link to the images and references. To put an additional prefix to it might not be necessary anymore, example_ was used because all paths where used taken the inside of the gallery folder as reference, so having the prefix became valuable. As a generic option I would rather remove example_ prefix than the first folder auto_example

Right; glad to add more simple filters. It's very easy to map from the simple filters to the more complex ones. The complex filters were needed to mirror the logic of the example I ported, but I could also change it to use specific collections and images (and tell users they were determined by searches on the website).

In the previous examples, the benefit was using Pandas' filtering mechanisms, which tend to lead to simpler code. But I just don't see it as an option here, unless we limit users to very simple filters (which I think would be a shame).
