If you look at how Harvard-Oxford is used (for instance in the following example:

Hence, I suggest putting in this field of the bunch, the ""labels"" field of the current structure, and a adding two other fields; one ""regions_coords"" that would be the current ""labels[['x', 'y', 'z']].tolist()"", and one ""network_name"" that would contain the ""networks"" field of the CSV.

As a results, the code should look much more similar for Harvard-Oxford and for MSDL.
