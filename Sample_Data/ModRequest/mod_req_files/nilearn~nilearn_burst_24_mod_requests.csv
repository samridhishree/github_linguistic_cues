I can make new smoke tests (that will increase code coverage) but it won't be useful... The only way to test the dataset fetchers in real conditions is to create phony dataset files (ie files that mimic the dataset tree) locally, as it has already been done for haxby simple.

@GaelVaroquaux do we make smoke tests, tests with phony files or no test at all ?
