After cleaning confounds with signal.clean, the outputted timeseries are correlated with confound even if they were not before. I don't know if it's a bug or I am using it wrong. Here is code I used

    confounds = time_series_raw[:,0]
    signals = time_series_raw
    cleaned_signals = signal.clean(signals, confounds=confounds, standardize=False, detrend=False)

    plt.plot(signals)
    plt.title('Time series before cleaning')
    plt.legend(['confound', 'signal', 'signal', 'signal'])
    plt.show()

    cleaned_signals[:,0] = confounds*-1
    plt.plot(cleaned_signals)
    plt.title('Time series after cleaning')
    plt.legend(['-1 * confound', 'signal', 'signal', 'signal'])
    plt.show()

And here are images of the timeseries before and after cleaning

I would expect that the timeseries would be more or less straight after cleaning. Here it seems that by trying to remove artefacts, I am adding them even to voxels that were previously fine.

Yes, Simpson's paradox is still not understood by practionners. It has
spured a controversy on ""global signal regression"" with thousands of
citations that can simply be explained by the fact that more people need
to read the wikipedia pages on statistical paradoxes.

issue_comment,1419,nilearn,nilearn,dinga92,2017-03-24 00:24:28,"Thanks for your response. I think it happens because confounds are not being centered if detrend and standardize are False. It works if `detrend = True` however in that case the cleaned time series are centered. It cleans the timeseries without centering the outputs if I set detrend and standardize to False and input already centered confounds.

Is this an expected behavior?

issue_comment,1419,nilearn,nilearn,bthirion,2017-03-24 08:35:09,"I think so. 
1. In general, I see no reason not to detrend / normalize.
2. We want users to be able to work with undetrended signal, but then the confounds are not detrended either which leads to the weird results that you obtained.
3. ""Manually"" detrending the confounds is an option. I see that as a feature for advances users, so it is reasonable not ta have it as a default behavior.",,,I think 1 In gener I see reason detrend normal 2 We want user abl work undetrend signal confound detrend either lead weird result obtain 3 manual detrend confound option I see featur advanc user reason ta default behavior
