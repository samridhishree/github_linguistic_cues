issue_title,736,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-07-29 10:08:16,"Nilearn's code has growth a lot since the last time we audited it. New patterns, such as `new_img_like` that loads an img, may sometimes encourage object persistence when they are not really needed and their memory could be freed.

It would be a good thing to do a pass on the code to check that.

Also, it would be really awesome to have memory tests. Using `ulimit` linux command, it is easy to set a bound to memory consumption and thus check that we are not leaking.
