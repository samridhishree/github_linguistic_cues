issue_title,793,nilearn,nilearn,arthurmensch,2015-10-14 08:57:11,"This is due to the use of non safe `get_data` in `copy_img`.

Typically this invalidate cache:

``` python

def f(img):
    print('Not cached')

mem = Memory(cache_dir='nilearn_cache')
img = NiftiImage(np.ones(10, 10, 10, 10), affine=np.ones(4))

mem.cache(f)(img)
mem.cache(f)(img)
img2 = copy_img(img)
mem.cache(f)(img)
```

Output:

```
Not cached
Not cached
```

I changed it but it still creates a new image because it uses new_img_like() from nilearn.image.image
I can substitute the whole line and return just _safe_get_data(img). 
Is this fine? In this case, instead of 
`new_img_like(img, img.get_data().copy(), img.get_affine().copy(),  copy_header=True)`
it just makes a deep copy
`img = copy.deepcopy(img)`
if it is not cached inside _safe_get_data. 

If you agree I change it. I wrote the test based on what Arthur did.
