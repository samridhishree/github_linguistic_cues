issue_title,466,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-02-27 09:28:54,"Originally, two functions were created to load niimages:
- `check_niimg` for 3D images
- `check_niimgs` for 4D images

However, both have grown to accept the other type of images. `check_niimg(ensure_3d=False)` can load 4D images. `check_niimgs(accept_3d=True)` can load 3D images. This is pertinent in certain cases (eg, some sessions are represented by several 4D nifti with shape `[..., 1]`) but ATM the functions are clearly doing more than they should. Since both functions seem to converge, we may want to consider having only one function.

Issue #463 should be addressed during this refactoring.

Please discuss this matter here but use this wiki page as working document: https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/wiki/Loading-niimgs

Is there any hard reason why we cannot merge the two functions into a single `check_niimgs` with the functionality of both, that is:
- return iterables
- autoresample
- (not) accepted 3D niimg-like objects
- caching

> Since both functions seem to converge, we may want to consider having only one function.

I think that having two functions is saner because:
- the 4D would make call to the 3D function (which is better than having recurrence and `if` statements)
- some functionalities are exclusive to the 4D function (`return_iterator` for example).
