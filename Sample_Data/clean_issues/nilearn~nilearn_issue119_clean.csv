issue_title,119,nilearn,nilearn,eickenberg,2013-10-29 14:11:58,"Especially after resampling in oblique directions and using the heuristic of taking the biggest bounding box containing the rotated original bounding box, one is left with a lot of dead space within the new nifti file.

Similar things can happen after skull stripping an anatomical, if the niimg keeps the same dimensions.

A simple cropping mechanism which finds the closest bounding box around the non-zero part of the nifti file and adjusts the translation part of the affine accordingly, if necessary, is easy to write.

A co-developer, who prefers to remain anonymous, and goes by the pseudonym ""@AlexandreAbraham"", thought it may be useful to propose adding it to e.g. the resampling tools.

What does nilearn think?

It would be useful. I am +1. An boolean option like 'tight_bounds' might
be the right way to expose it.

OK, I am +1 for this to be by default, but the way that I would like it
to happen is with bounds computed on the mask, and not computed
automatically from the image... Now, we may need to have a
memory-efficient mask computation routine, but that's needed anyhow.

> This could also be useful for people who inverse_transform large arrays

That would be a surprising behavior: one expects inverse_transform to
behave as close as possible to the inverse of the transform.

In these settings, I am OK with it being by default: I don't see any
adverse consequence.

I believe that we limit the amount of options :)

Yes, this is the type of behavior that I would like.

Right. I'll let you see how it is best implemented.

Yes, this is the easiest way.

What I meant is that, if I plan to inverse_transform large arrays, then I may set the option tight_bounds = True. We should obviously not crop without a request of the user.
