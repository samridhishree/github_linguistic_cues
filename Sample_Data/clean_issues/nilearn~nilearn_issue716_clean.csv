issue_title,716,nilearn,nilearn,dohmatob,2015-07-22 09:04:59,"I'm getting drastically different results in my estimmators, depending on whether I use NiftiMasker of MultiNiftiMasker. Looking deeper into the problem, it seems the nifti masker factor has some consistency problems. For example, it seems the way the masking is done is dramatically different from one class to another.

**Test case**

`
from nose.tools import assert_equal
    import nibabel
    from nilearn.input_data import NiftiMasker, MultiNiftiMasker

```
def test_maskers_consistent():
    # make a series of (real-world!) 3D images
    img = nibabel.load(""nilearn/datasets/data/avg152T1_brain.nii.gz"")
    affine = img.get_affine()
    data = img.get_data()
    X = []
    for _ in range(5):
        data_ = data.copy()
        img_ = nibabel.Nifti1Image(data_, affine)
        X.append(img_)

    # NiftiMasker and MultiNifiMasker should produce the same mask
    nm = NiftiMasker().fit(X)
    mnm = MultiNiftiMasker().fit(X)
    assert_equal(nm.mask_img_.get_data().sum(),
                 mnm.mask_img_.get_data().sum())
```

In this case, it's true. But Elvis showed me another case where he gets 120k voxels using NiftiMasker and 170k voxels using MultiNiftiMasker. But, as you said, they are different objects.

No. The discussion about scalability of the nifti masker(s) is an
orthogonal problem to your PR. You should move on with your PR using the
nifti masker.

Does it work for 100 subjects?
