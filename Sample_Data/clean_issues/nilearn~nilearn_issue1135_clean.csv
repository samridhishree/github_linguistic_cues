issue_title,1135,nilearn,nilearn,alexsavio,2016-06-17 12:40:07,"Hi,
I am struggling a bit with an error in `nilearn.plotting.displays`.

First I use `nilearn.plotting.find_cut_slices` to find a specific number of cuts for a image in the `z` direction. Then I plot some of these cuts (because I am building a grid of plots) with `plot_stat_map`. I use a custom `bg_img` which is in the same space as the input image. The approach has been working well so far.

With the last update, I have 2 problems:
- the `bg_img` does not appear anymore (I get blobs over black) and
- in one case so far, the `data_2d_list` variable in [displays.py line 651](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/plotting/displays.py#L651) ends up full of None, so `ims` is empty.

Any insight will be appreciated. Thanks!

Thanks!

I prepared a minimal case for the `data_2d_list` problem. I can't reproduce the first issue though, will keep checking.

I fixed the `bg_img` problem, I had to fix the figure size in the plot function. I am not sure yet why it was working before and it stopped working.
