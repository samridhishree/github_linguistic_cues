issue_title,458,idan,oauthlib,hoylen,2017-01-20 06:03:34,"Updated documentation so it is clear that PyJWT (and not any jwt library) is needed. Corrected ""pip install"" command to install ""pyjwt"" instead of ""jwt"".

Added more information to the `NotImplemented` exception messages. Instead of saying ""Subclasses must implement this function"", it is now more useful because it says ""Missing function implementation in className: nameOfMissingFunction"".

Extra logging has been added to help in debugging. During development, the _signature base string_ signed by the client may be different from the one independently calculated by the server: logging these string helps debug such problems.

pull_request_commit_comment,458,idan,oauthlib,hoylen,2017-07-30 08:22:08,"Because OAuthLib has dependencies, so it is not ""dependency free"". The description of ""dependency free"" would mean it does not need any other package to run. OAuthLib (as indicated in the _requirements.txt_ file) needs PyJWT, blinker and cryptography packages to function.

I'm trying to guess what the original author really meant, and assume they meant to say it can be used with any framework (e.g. doesn't have to be Django) rather than ""dependency free"" (which it is clearly not, since it has dependencies).",46230575731178b69956debfd40371d26bbd3bf3,"(5, '', u'docs/oauth1/server.rst')",becaus oauthlib depend depend free the descript depend free would mean need packag run oauthlib indic requirementstxt file need pyjwt blinker cryptographi packag function Im tri guess origin author realli meant assum meant say use framework eg doesnt django rather depend free clearli sinc depend
