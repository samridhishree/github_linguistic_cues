This is not really a joblib issue, nor a nibabel one, this is why I open it here.

It shouldn't: joblib doesn't use the repr, but an actual hash of the
data. There must be something more. Do you have a small example to
reproduce the problem. I'd love to look at it.

However, I still have a problem. I have no minimal use case for the moment, I'll let you know when I have.

issue_comment,97,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2013-08-20 13:40:26,"My problem was due to the fact that Nifti1Image hash (and therefore internal state) changes when calling get_data(). Concretely, when loading a Nifti1Image, only the header is loaded, data is loaded when calling get_data(), which break joblib caching. I will make a patch for my usecase (call get_data() on the loaded Nifti1Image in masker if a path is given) and maybe add a note in documentation (this would be a good occasion to start a troubleshooting page).
