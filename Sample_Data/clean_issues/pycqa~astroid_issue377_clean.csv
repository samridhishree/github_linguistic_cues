issue_comment,377,pycqa,astroid,PCManticore,2016-12-16 13:19:16,"Not currently. At this moment, astroid==1.5.0 and pylint==2.0.0 are using a lot of new features, some of them being a bit unstable, there are some issues to fix before committing to a release. But more important than this is that pylint==2.0.0 is not ready yet, there are some improvements scheduled for it, but there is a slow progress towards achieving this thing, since I don't have a lot of time on my hands lately. Once we manage to complete the issues that are in the 2.0 milestone, we can proceed with a release. Unfortunately, the current astroid master has to wait for pylint==2.0.0, because otherwise, astroid 1.5.0== will be incompatible with pylint==1.7.0 for example.

Another solution that we did in the past was to cherry-pick a lot of relevant changes from master branch into a separate release branch and do the release from there. I've been doing this twice and I am not going there again. This time both master branches will be released at the same time.",,,not current At moment astroid150 pylint200 use lot new featur bit unstabl issu fix commit releas but import pylint200 readi yet improv schedul slow progress toward achiev thing sinc I dont lot time hand late onc manag complet issu 20 mileston proceed releas unfortun current astroid master wait pylint200 otherwis astroid 150 incompat pylint170 exampl anoth solut past cherrypick lot relev chang master branch separ releas branch releas ive twice I go thi time master branch releas time
