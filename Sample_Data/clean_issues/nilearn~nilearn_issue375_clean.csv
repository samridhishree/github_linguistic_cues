Things that still need to be done:

- [ ] example .py and .png in the rst doc need to be updated because examples have moved around

- [ ] just checking: there is a standardize=True for the masker in plot_haxby_rpbi.py with a comment that says that it is important for RPBI. The thing is that standardize=True is not used for the other RPBI examples. Any reason why?

issue_comment,375,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-02-23 06:07:03,"@lesteve I have been looking at this today, I think it could be useful for some of the RSA things I've been doing in the background.

I'd be happy to help push this forward.  I can take care of the merge conflicts and take care of the printing / verbose issues, for example.  I also think the coding of the `plot_haxby_rpbi` example could be simplified.    

I also had a couple of questions about analysis choices made in the `plot_haxby_rpbi` example.  I worry that my questions / concerns may be naive (I am still very new to neuroimaging analysis), but I will follow up with them in case they're questions others might have in learning from the examples.

issue_comment,375,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-02-23 06:44:02,"2 questions to start:
- Why does the Haxby example limit data to houses and faces?  I think a comment there would be helpful.
- The code mentions that it takes the mean image per condition, as different samples within the same session have dependencies in time.
  - Isn't this issue also true (to a lesser degree) between conditions (house vs. face)?
  - Would this be (at least partially) alleviated by passing `detrend=True` in the mask?
  - Is this really a concern in a block design (24s per stimulus, 12s of rest in-between)?

That would be great indeed! There was some interest about working on it during the 0.1 sprint but other issues were deemed more important at the time.

I guess the first thing would be to rebase on master and fix merge conflicts. The bullet points mentioned in my message at the very top are good next steps.

issue_comment,375,nilearn,nilearn,eickenberg,2015-02-27 12:01:11,"> Isn't this issue also true (to a lesser degree) between conditions (house vs. face)?

Probably, but the extent depends on long range temporal interactions (which are typically drift components) that are difficult to quantify

> Is this really a concern in a block design (24s per stimulus, 12s of rest in-between)?

Drift cutoff in nipy GLM is set by default to a period of 128s. If the interactions are really that long, then this would be a concern. 

> Would this be (at least partially) alleviated by passing detrend=True in the mask?

Probably. But as mentioned elsewhere, this detrending needs to be done by chunks (as indicated by the `chunk` variable in the label data)

https://github.com/bcipolli/nilearn/tree/rpbi

Thanks @eickenberg ; I can perhaps include some of that in the example (like the detrending in chunks), and a bit more in comments.  I also think the code can be cleaned up a bit (after working through the example for some of the RSA-focused work I'm doing).

I'll also take a look at the bullet points listed!

We should check in RPBI that data is standardize and raise a warning if not.

issue_comment,375,nilearn,nilearn,bthirion,2015-12-18 13:36:16,"I am wondering what the right placeholder for that method is: Nilearn/Nistats. There are two blockers: 
- the structure instantiated to obtain the p-values through permutation is a bit complex / hard to maintain.
- Ward clustering is very slow. Renn should be implemented instead.
  The second point is easy to address, not the first one.

An idea that we have currently is to have a procedure that does not require the permutations, but this is a topic of research. Should go to nilearn-sandbox ?
