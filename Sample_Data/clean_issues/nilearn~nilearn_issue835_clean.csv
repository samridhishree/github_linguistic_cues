issue_title,835,nilearn,nilearn,KamalakerDadi,2015-11-08 12:17:33,"problem when trying to port code from `RegionExtractor` to `nilearn.image.image`. Because of this ""global imports"" problem, I have imported internally whichever necessary. It worked.

But, I think we should fix this problem. To not to get the same problem to others. 
Discussions and ideas are welcome.

This is out of box but if anybody wants why I am doing this. please have a look at my `RegionExtractor` PR to-do list.
