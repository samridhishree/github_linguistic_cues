PEP 484 (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/) tries to standardize the use of annotations for type hints in the language. At its core lies the typing module, which provides the abstractions needed by a type checker in order to understands type hints. Try to see how this can be used in pylint / astroid and also add support for type hints through them.
