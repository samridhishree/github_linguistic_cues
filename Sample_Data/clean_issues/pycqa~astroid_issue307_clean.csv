issue_title,307,pycqa,astroid,dbaum,2016-01-15 17:44:46,"This particular test sometimes fails, although I have not figured out a way to make it fail reliably.  Here is the error message:
## FAIL: test_builtin_fromlineno_missing (unittest_nodes.ArgumentsNodeTC)

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""/Users/dbaum/Desktop/pylint/astroid/astroid/tests/unittest_nodes.py"", line 507, in test_builtin_fromlineno_missing
    self.assertEqual(new.args.fromlineno, 0)
AssertionError: 1 != 0

Unfortunately, altering the test code often causes the flakiness to go away which is making it hard to instrument.  I was able to get it to fail occasionally with the following instrumentation:

```
    new_list = cls.getattr('__new__')
    for x in new_list:
      try:
        print x.name, x.args.fromlineno
      except Exception:
        print x
    new = new_list[-1]
    self.assertEqual(new.args.fromlineno, 0)
```

On I failure I see:

**new** ImportFrom.**new**(modname='**builtin**',
                   names=[('**new**', None)],
                   level=0)
**new** ImportFrom.**new**(modname='**builtin**',
                   names=[('**new**', None)],
                   level=0)
**new** 0
**new** 0
**new** 1

On success I see:

**new** ImportFrom.**new**(modname='**builtin**',
                   names=[('**new**', None)],
                   level=0)
**new** ImportFrom.**new**(modname='**builtin**',
                   names=[('**new**', None)],
                   level=0)
**new** 0
**new** 1
**new** 0

This leads me to believe that the order of getattr() results is non-deterministic.

issue_comment,307,pycqa,astroid,dbaum,2016-01-15 17:52:39,"More info: upon success the last two values from getattr() are 

<BoundMethod **new** of **builtin**.type at 0x4597724240
<BoundMethod **new** of **builtin**.object at 0x4597883472

on failure they are:

<BoundMethod **new** of **builtin**.object at 0x4529744784
<BoundMethod **new** of **builtin**.type at 0x4529787216

So it comes down to the ordering of object and type and one has an args with fromlineno=0 and the other has fromlineno=1.

issue_comment,307,pycqa,astroid,dbaum,2016-01-15 17:59:45,"Now I'm very confused.  When running just the one test file it looks like the fromlineno on both type and object are 0.  When running all tests via test discovery then the args for type seem to have fromlineno=1.  But I'm not even sure this is 100% true.  I'm out of my depth here.

issue_comment,307,pycqa,astroid,PCManticore,2016-01-15 19:53:49,"There's also https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/issues/195 for tracking this issue, which has nothing to do with the order of the results of getattr. The problem is caused by https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/blob/master/astroid/node_classes.py#L387, which uses as a line number, in case one is not defined for a node, the first one of the children or the parents of the node. This happens usually with builtin modules, since there is no way to find out on which lines they actually are. The approach is definitely not a good idea and the fix would be to remove fixed_source_line altogether and leave such nodes with a line number not set. While this is rather easy, the hard thing is going through pylint and see where this might trip an exception or something undefined. Unfortunately I didn't have time to look over pylint for this issue.
