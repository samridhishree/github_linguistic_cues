Yes, please!  There are very good reasons to want to use oauthlib without
requests, e.g. as a straight up replacement for the long abandoned oauth.  In
fact, a little user guide for converting from oauth to oauthlib would be
fantastic.  It's not a difficult conversion, although it's a bit of a brain
twister at first because of the different terminology.

Sorry, my stack is too deep at the moment to contribute such documentation,
but if pressed I could probably dig up a diff.

Yep.  Notice the Uploaded date :)

Okay, piston-mini-client is one package I'm working on.  This is not fully
tested yet (note the as yet unported PLAINTEXT signature method), but it
should give you an idea of what I had to change to do the conversion.  Once I
get this working, I might even submit a more detailed blurb for the
documentation.

issue_comment,79,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2012-11-17 00:27:30,"The oauthlib bits look alright. If you want to use plaintext as a signature method use either

```
Client(..., signature_method=""PLAINTEXT"")

```
from oauthlib.oauth1.rfc5849 import SIGNATURE_PLAINTEXT

Will add imports of the constants in oauthlib.oauth1.**init**.py tomorrow so you can omit ""rfc4849"". If you are interested in RSA-SHA1 signatures have a look at https://gist.github.com/2584789
