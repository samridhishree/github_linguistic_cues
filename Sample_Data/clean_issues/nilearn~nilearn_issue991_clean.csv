issue_comment,991,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2016-02-17 10:23:36,"Another option would be to have the function that we are benching do it's operations three times. Indeed, I suspect that the reason that we are witnessing zero memory usage is that the function is too fast and memory is cleared before. Thus the strategy of running the function 3 times inside the memory_usage might be more reliable.

Yes, but this would require to apply the change upstream.

Or just to do:

<pre>
def func_3_times(args, **kwargs):
   for _ in range(3):
        func(args, **kwargs)
</pre>

and to bench func_3_times instead of func. No?

Nice suggestion which makes sense and works as well. I pushed a commit with it.
