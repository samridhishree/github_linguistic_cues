However, the transformation could easily be done via a simple padding of arrays.

We should probably be able to detect this with the ""A"" matrix on line

which should pretty much be the identity. Once we've detected this, the challenge will be write code that computes the translation and padding.

The benefit might be a large speedup in some settings, as often the mask and the data are on the same grid (typically the grid of the MNI template at a given resolution), but with a different FOV that was inherited from where they originated.",start issue,"Avoid resampling when it's just different FOV, and not different affine",for two imag look data differ fov nilearnimageresampleimg current use affin resampl straegi howev transform could easili done via simpl pad array We probabl abl detect A matrix line pretti much ident onc weve detect challeng write code comput translat pad the benefit might larg speedup set often mask data grid typic grid mni templat given resolut differ fov inherit origin
