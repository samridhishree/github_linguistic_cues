In the example that plays with alpha_, how about we add
ConnectivityMeasure in a section after that.

We should start using more sections in examples. They make for better
readability.

Well, we still have to import them, and so talk about them. The problem
with ConnectivityMeasure with one subject is that it forces this tricky
thing of using a list to pass the data in ConnectivityMeasure, and to
take the first element of that list out. It's easy to get wrong, and not
get an very useful error message.

Possibly. But I would think that these people need to do multiple
subjects, or multiple sessions, in which case, they should be using
ConnectivityMeasure anyhow.

I am hesitating. So you think it's preferable to teach how covariance estimators work for 1 subject, then say these estimators are encompassed in ConnectivityMeasure which is suitable for a group. 

May be it's the right way, but I stick to normalizing the covariances/precisions. Plus in all examples we standardize, so  actually we have correlations but are calling them covariances. All this is mixing up things for someone who is thinking in terms of connections.
