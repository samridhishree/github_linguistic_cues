in the scipy C code. Add test.

Full disclosure: I haven't investigated the penalty performance of copying the data for big images. I tried to put together a heuristic a little while ago to decide whether the array was big enough to trigger this segmentation fault but I didn't have time to investigate fully.

Fixes #346.
