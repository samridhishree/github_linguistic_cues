issue_title,1426,nilearn,nilearn,SylvainLan,2017-04-03 15:50:47,"Under the supervision from Bertrand Thirion, I have read the documentation of nilearn and may express some comments. 

**General comments** : 
-Even though people tend not to read a documentation sequentially, the sections 4 (plotting) and 5 (manipulating brain volumes) could be put in position 2 and 3. I think it is more convenient to handle statistical tools when one knows and understands the concept of masks. 

-The code in the documentation is often not straightforward and it could be a plus if one could just copy and paste the lines on an iPython terminal to run it. 

-Some parts are redundant and there are explanations of the same subject which come many times in the doc (eg the construction and the inverse of a masker)

**Some warnings**
The code is highly dependent to the sklearn library, and some deprecation warnings appear for : 
-the cross-validation
-other deprecation warning concerning matplotlib (axisbg has to be changed to facecolor)

**Minor requests**
Here are some subjectives remarks on the content of the documentation. In parenthesis is the related part of the documentation : 
-(3.3.1.3) Isn't it possible to order the components to the best independent to the least? 
-(3.3.2) The dictionary learning could be explained a bit 
-(3.4) This section seems redundant with the two previous ones (3.3 and 3.2) and could be merged
-(4.2) The slice selection is not clear when automatic
-(6) This section is a recap of all the previous ones and does not add a lot, but may be volunteer.",start issue,General comments on the documentation,under supervis bertrand thirion I read document nilearn may express comment gener comment even though peopl tend read document sequenti section 4 plot 5 manipul brain volum could put posit 2 3 I think conveni handl statist tool one know understand concept mask the code document often straightforward could plu one could copi past line ipython termin run some part redund explan subject come mani time doc eg construct invers masker some warn the code highli depend sklearn librari deprec warn appear crossvalid deprec warn concern matplotlib axisbg chang facecolor minor request here subject remark content document In parenthesi relat part document 3313 isnt possibl order compon best independ least 332 the dictionari learn could explain bit 34 thi section seem redund two previou one 33 32 could merg 42 the slice select clear automat 6 thi section recap previou one add lot may volunt

As far as I have followed, these warnings are fixed with this PRs #1291 and #1342 in master.

>-other deprecation warning concerning matplotlib (axisbg has to be changed to facecolor)

Fixed with this PR #1395 and one PR #1423 under review. 

Are you able to still see these warnings despite of these fixes ?

I agree with concept of masks. But, then leads to further discussion and approvals from other people before refactoring.

If you have observed, we point the link to the example in each section so users can play with the example in IPython.

Not so clear. May be you can point to the section.

Merging things can make complex to understand for the users showing everything in one complete section. That's why we made into two parts. Region extraction is a post-processing method when someone wants to split networks into regions. I feel it is in good position in terms of ordering of the section.",,,As far I follow warn fix pr 1291 1342 master fix PR 1395 one PR 1423 review are abl still see warn despit fix I agre concept mask but lead discuss approv peopl refactor If observ point link exampl section user play exampl ipython not clear may point section merg thing make complex understand user show everyth one complet section that made two part region extract postprocess method someon want split network region I feel good posit term order section
