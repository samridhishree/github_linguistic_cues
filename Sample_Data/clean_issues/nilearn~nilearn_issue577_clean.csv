A bit of both, mainly nilearn's fault.

What happens is that data is loaded in `uint8` type and then some magic happens in the code and the data is converted to `int8` that is not supported by the data format.

IMHO, converting data implictly is utterly wrong.

Second, I am very worried about supporting mgz. I think that this is feature creep. Very few people use it, and if we try supporting it, I am afraid that it will be broken most often. Our docs clearly talk about 'niimg like', ie NiftiImage like, which mgz is.

I guess that my point of view on this problem is that we will accept a PR fixing it in a clean way, and if people join the dev team to support mgz files, its fine. But I don't feel like allocating our already sparse resources to it.

What could potentially speak against this? (It makes sense from the point of view that `uint8` is in a certain sense a smallest increment in complexity wrt `bool`, but I don't know if there are practical implications that would be counterindications to this choice)

It's less often used (at least in the analyze / nifti world), thus we run
into more chances that a software does not recognize it.
