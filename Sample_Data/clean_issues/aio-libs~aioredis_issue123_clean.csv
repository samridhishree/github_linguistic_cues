issue_comment,123,aio-libs,aioredis,popravich,2016-05-25 15:05:56,"Hi guys,
I agree with ushuz that such `Queue` should not be included in `aioredis`,
because its hard to satisfy everybodys needs: someone may want Queue based on lists
someone may want it based on sorted sets, someone may want it to be built with some other concept.

Anyway, you can publish you Queue implementation on pypi and give me a link to be included in docs.
I think it would be really helpful for lib users to see a list with such extensions.
