issue_title,1204,nilearn,nilearn,ahoyosid,2016-08-05 09:25:19,"I've been working with SpaceNet without a precomputed mask, then it computes the mask with a mask_stategy = 'epi', and I need 'background' instead.
But there is no parameter in the API to change it.

This is a minor change in the code, I wouldn't mind to do it if you guys think is useful.
