---

The MyPy people have done a lot of work creating files containing the signatures of builtin/stdlib functions at https://github.com/python/typeshed.  By automatically processing the stub files, it would be possible to create more accurate mock ASTs for functions that aren't introspectable.

issue_comment,254,pycqa,astroid,PCManticore,2017-01-25 19:34:50,"I'm not sure, I think every tool has their own, e.g. mypy, pytype and PyCharm, but I might be wrong on this. It will be huge, but it won't replace astroid.brain entirely. astroid.brain is much more potent than the ``.pyi`` files, because we can modify the AST at will, which leads to advanced inference support for:

* builtins

* constructs that depends on highly dynamic code such as enums and namedtuples

* tailored support for various libraries

We can't have this out of the box with ``.pyi`` files, so brain is here to stay, although probably not in its current form.",,,Im sure I think everi tool eg mypi pytyp pycharm I might wrong It huge wont replac astroidbrain entir astroidbrain much potent pyi file modifi ast lead advanc infer support builtin construct depend highli dynam code enum namedtupl tailor support variou librari We cant box pyi file brain stay although probabl current form
