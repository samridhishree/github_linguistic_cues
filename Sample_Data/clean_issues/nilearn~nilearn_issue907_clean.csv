issue_comment,907,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2016-01-13 09:18:29,"> IMHO the semantics of this parameters would be clearer if it were between 0 and 1, as it would represent a fraction of the population, which is easier to explain.

It is easier to explain but it defeats the purpose of the method presented here. The main advantage of this thresholding approach is that you can chose a value corresponding to a certain level of sparsity in the brain (1 if you want to avoid overlap, up to 3 if overlaps are OK for you) and then, no matter how many maps you provide, your atlas will always ""look"" the same, no adjustment needed. When dealing with a lot of atlases, I find it very convenient.

issue_comment,907,nilearn,nilearn,KamalakerDadi,2016-01-08 15:23:40,"Just to share some information about the usage of threshold and its strategies:

regions extraction based on statistical thresholds can be used based upon selecting `thresholding_strategy='img_value'` which will act according to given threshold in statistical value provided that the value should not exceed the `max`.

regions extraction based on selection threshold can be done upon selecting `thresholding_strategy='ratio_n_voxels'` or `thresholding_strategy='percentile'` where threshold should be given upon the n_maps provided should not exceed more than n_maps as stated in the error message.

In this particular error case, selecting `thresholding_strategy='img_value'` should work if one is trying to threshold upon their statistical values or otherwise leaving to defaults should also work.

We had naming problem before. Since, we have two different strategies, fixing one name from current `threshold` to `ratio` or `selection_ratio`  will again be a conflict to statistical thresholding strategy. Let me know if I am wrong.
