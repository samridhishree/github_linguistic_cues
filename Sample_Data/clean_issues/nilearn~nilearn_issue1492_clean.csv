For me, I didn't get your question. plot_connectome does plots connectivity matrices on a glass brain.

Do you have any example to show what you meant by using seaborn color libraries ?",,,for I didnt get question plotconnectom plot connect matric glass brain Do exampl show meant use seaborn color librari
issue_comment,1492,nilearn,nilearn,KamalakerDadi,2017-08-18 17:21:02,">In other words, I wish to be able to simply do something like the following instead:

I am afraid there is no straightforward to do what you are asking.
One thing you could try.

```python
connectome = plotting.plot_connectome(conn_matrixA, coordsA,
                                      edge_threshold=99%, node_color='red')
connectome.add_graph()
```
To know how to use ```add_graph```, you can have a look at plot_connectome plotting function code.
Hope this helps.

",,,I afraid straightforward ask one thing could tri To know use look plotconnectom plot function code hope help

Good that it worked for you. Closing this one then.",,,good work close one
issue_comment,1492,nilearn,nilearn,dpisner453,2017-08-18 15:22:15,"Sure, what I want to avoid is having to do this:

```
##where membership_plotting here is a 2-column array of coordinates and categories of membership to different communities
n = len(membership_plotting.unique())
clust_pal = sns.color_palette(""Set2"", n)
clust_lut = dict(zip(map(str, np.unique(membership_plotting.astype('category'))), clust_pal))
clust_colors = colors.to_rgba_array(membership_plotting.map(clust_lut))
plotting.plot_connectome(conn_matrix, coords, node_color = clust_colors, edge_threshold=edge_threshold, node_size=20, colorbar=True)

In other words, I wish to be able to simply do something like the following instead:
```
connectome = plotting.plot_connectome(conn_matrixA, coordsA, edge_threshold=99%, node_color='red')
connectome.add_overlay_connectome(conn_matrixB, coordsB, edge_threshold=99%, node_color='blue')
##Where the latter function 'add_overlay_connectome' does not exist in nilearn
```

How can I easily go about overlaying to different connectome plot on the same glass brain? Maybe there is a straightforward way to do this already that I'm just not aware of in nilearn?

Hopefully my question makes a bit more sense now :-/",,,sure I want avoid In word I wish abl simpli someth like follow instead how I easili go overlay differ connectom plot glass brain mayb straightforward way alreadi Im awar nilearn hope question make bit sens
