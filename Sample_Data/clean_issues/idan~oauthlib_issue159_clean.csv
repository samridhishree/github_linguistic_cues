> The value of the scope parameter is expressed as a list of space-delimited, case-sensitive strings.

To quote the scope, there are two possibilities, one is (`urllib.quote`):

```
scope=foo%20bar
```

The other is (`urllib.quote_plus`):

```
scope=foo+bar
```

And why oauthlib choose the plus one? What does the rfc really means?

These are two different ways of representing an url encoded space character, both + and %20 are valid. Although + is imo easier on the eye. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding#The_application.2Fx-www-form-urlencoded_type for more details.
