While writing tests, I stumbled upon a strange behaviour in request's `duplicate_params` property, if I understood correct there's a bug involving operators precedence.

Thanks for sorting out some of the direly missing unit tests for this grant type. 

Regarding the duplicate params I've not looked into it much, might very well be precedence.

I am not a big fan of using a parenthesis for importing like this so imo it is either between explicitly importing what you need (one per line)

```
from oauthlib.oauth2.rfc6749.errors import UnsupportedGrantTypeError
from oauthlib.oauth2.rfc6749.errors import InvalidClientError
```

or to import the module only and prefix with that

```
from oauthlib.oauth2.rfc6749 import errors
```

I don't feel strongly about either. The former makes it very obvious what methods are used, the latter is less code and is arguably better for dynamic inspection.

@masci thoughts?
