issue_title,1097,nilearn,nilearn,alexsavio,2016-05-12 12:53:47,"What about allowing scalar input arguments as well as `img_like` in `math_img`?
I created an adapter for it and as far as I see it wouldn't make any harm to be actually inside `math_img`. IMO this would help doing function composition with this function.

I guess I could add some checks or change how I check for a scalar, but a simple version would be this:

``` python
import numpy as np
from six import string_types

def math_img(formula, **imgs):
    """""" Use nilearn.image.math_img. """"""
    from nilearn.image import math_img
    for name, arg in imgs.items():
        if isinstance(arg, string_types):
            continue

        if np.isscalar(arg):
            formula = formula.replace(name, str(arg))
            imgs.pop(name)

    return math_img(formula=formula, **imgs)
```
",start issue,Allow scalars in `math_img`,what allow scalar input argument well I creat adapt far I see wouldnt make harm actual insid imo would help function composit function I guess I could add check chang I check scalar simpl version would

grasp and with horrible error message. In addition, I can see people
asking for more, once we allow scalars.
