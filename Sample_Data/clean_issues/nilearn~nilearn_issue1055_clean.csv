``` python
from nilearn.datasets import fetch_acpi
dataset = fetch_acpi()
```

It seems to work. A few comments:
- `fetch_acpi` should be imported and listed in the `__all__` variable of the `__init__.py`of the datasets module.
- I had a warning at the very beginning of the fetch: 
  `Warning: Could not find dataset description.`

Download is still in progress. Will give more feedback later.

I asked Kamalakar because he has already downloaded everything.

Regarding the other issues, this is normal. This PR is a quickie to allow Kamalakar to download the dataset. Proper documentation will come later.

Since data extraction always find the same folder for each bunch of 10 subjects download. For example, I tried to fetch FNIRT_S0_G0. 

``` python
IOError: Fetching aborted: [Errno 17] File exists: '/volatile/home/kamalakar/work/acpi/77d20ae3d4678e62721b461c115dac94/fnirt_s0_g0'
