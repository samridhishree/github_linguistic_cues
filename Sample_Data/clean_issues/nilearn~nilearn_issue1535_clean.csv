- This work around will be removed after a new matplotlib release
- Currently master is failing on this. [See](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/nilearn-ci/nilearn/build/1.0.2100/job/2cckvjw356wim35p)

We have two environments failing on master with AppVeyor CI.

One failure is because of the issues with recent matplotlib 2.1.0.
For instance, see the FIX made with travis and CircleCI a while ago.
See https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/1525
Similar step can taken here to force matplotlib install in this environment to 2.0.2.

Another failure is because of the conflict issues with matplotlib forced version 2.0.2 dependency in Python 3.4.3 environment. We have conflict issues for matplotlib > 2.0.0 with this Python version.

Here, I am upgrading environment to Python 3.5 and also forcing installation to 2.0.2 to make AppVeyor work. These temporary fix can be removed when the matplotlib 2.1.1 is released.

Hope it will be clear for review.",start issue,"FIX: Appveyor, force install matplotlib=2.0.2",temporari work around thi work around remov new matplotlib releas current master fail see We two environ fail master appveyor CI one failur issu recent matplotlib 210 for instanc see fix made travi circleci ago see similar step taken forc matplotlib instal environ 202 anoth failur conflict issu matplotlib forc version 202 depend python 343 environ We conflict issu matplotlib here I upgrad environ python 35 also forc instal 202 make appveyor work these temporari fix remov matplotlib 211 releas hope clear review
