This is my current personal and professional critical path.

1. How can I best help to make sure this is supported?
2. How can I best contribute?
3. If I did the work and made sure all the tests passed, is that all that is needed for the PR to be accepted?
4. I noticed other pending changes that deal with JWT's that are not jet merged in; are they missing something I need to be aware of to get my own PR in?

I didn't see a ""contributors guide"" checked into the source; so asking here as my current need is highly targeted to JWT and the docs all say to track this here.
