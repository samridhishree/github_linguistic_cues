issue_comment,629,nilearn,nilearn,banilo,2015-07-03 22:33:09,"> score

Why would you call it a `score` method? Would it not be better to stick with scikit learn conventions, such as `sklearn.decomposition.PCA.explained_variance_`

issue_comment,629,nilearn,nilearn,arthurmensch,2015-07-06 14:30:35,"It could be used to score test sets decomposed over fitted maps. I was more thinking about `log_likelihood` of a Gaussian fit.

We could also provide a `explained_variance_` attribute that would hold the explained variance of the maps over the training set
