issue_title,1231,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2016-08-09 05:44:03,"I was teaching today, and it stroke me that ConnectivityMeasure computes connectomes, and the name doesn't express this well. The ""Measure"" name doesn't capture the fact that it gives matrices, it feels more like a bivariate measure.

Not sure of a name? ConnectomeBuilder? ConnectomeEstimator?

Suggestions? Comments? Discussion?
