I guess in my case it is because of the resampling. I know there are some plans on imputation of missing data, but should we do something simpler in the meantime like settings the NaNs to zero?
The least we should do is raise a warning.

issue_comment,187,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2014-04-22 14:57:05,"Proposed solution: tackle the problem at the resampling level:

If they are NaNs in the data, take a mask of these, do an imputation of the data in this mask (using our imputation method that works by growing the data from the edges of the mask), resample the imputed data. In the mean-while, resample the mask and use the resampled mask to insert NaNs in the output image. This last step would be optional, to keep the imputed values in the output image.

Also, of course, we would spit a big nasty warning if there are NaNs, and the imputation option is not turned on.
