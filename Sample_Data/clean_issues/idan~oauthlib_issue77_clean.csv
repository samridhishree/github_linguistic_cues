issue_title,77,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2012-11-16 19:24:19,"Most people are likely to use OAuthLib indirectly, either through requests or through an extension to their favorite web framework, it would be good to make this explicit in the docs. 

However some will be interested in installing (rather than cloning) and at least PyPi instructions would be useful. Furthermore OAuthLib is included in ubuntu and possibly in other distros, maybe a few unices too, have a look around and add installation instructions.
