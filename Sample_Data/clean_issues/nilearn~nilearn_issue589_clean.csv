issue_comment,589,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-05-18 07:33:24,"I am wondering if we want to have such a function instead of educating the user about how to display several regions himself. The only additional logic in this function is the way the colormap is computed, which is a pain in matplotlib but for which we can provide a utility function.

I have one myself and so to do the same thing I write:

``` python
p = plot_anat(...)

for region_img, color in zip(iter_img(atlas_img), get_colors('gist_rainbow', len(atlas_img.shape[-1]))):
    p.add_countours(region_img, ...)
```

What would be (in my sense) a good addition for such function:
- a ""group"" heuristic for `find_cut_coords` because it will always be centered here I think (but this may be something to add in the slicer itself, an update of the cut coords when contours or overlays are added)
- an intelligent coloring code. Here, neighboring regions have similar colors because the atlas is made this way. We should write an algorithm to have maximum contrast between neigboring regions, this is a pain but this would be the new killer feature for me
- same code but with `add_overlay` to display several stat maps.

This will provide a lot of value for beginners. It's a feature that many
people have been curious about. Also, many of us have a copy-pasted
variant of this code. Getting is right is somewhat challenging, and each
time someone rewrites it, its time lost.

When something keeps coming up in people's code, it's often a good thing
to make a function out of it. Also, we are going to need it to make the
output of the ICA.

issue_comment,589,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-06-03 08:40:03,"> To avoid maximum overlaps between each maps, I used less value `threshold=1e-1`.

For me, this value has no sense. What we said about threshold:
- if threshold is a string, it must look like ""38%"" and, in that case, we keep all the values that are, in absolute, above the threshold of 38%
- if threshold if a float, we use this value as a threshold
- if threshold is a list, then the same rules as above apply but each map has a different threshold

You can take a look at the parameter `edge_threshold` of `plot_connectome` which is handled the same way.

Your problem is : when the percentile il too high, all values of the image are kept, including the 0. in the background.
For me, the solution would be to consider the background to be masked by default, because it's background. And this is not specific to the percentile mode. I would remove the `1e-6` and add, just before the return statement:

``` python
# Get rid of background values in all cases
