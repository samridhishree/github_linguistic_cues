issue_title,13,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2012-03-16 23:09:18,"Converted my old twitter example, went very smoothly =)

The example is very basic and far from using best practices but thought it might be of interest for people to see a working example. Who knows one day it might evolve into something decent.

It does require pull request #8, #12 to be merged to work.

However, I'm uncomfortable even hinting at a dependency in the repo's code itself, so I'm -1 on adding anything flask-based to oauthlib.

issue_comment,13,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2012-03-16 23:32:39,"Hrm can see where you are coming from. OAuthClient is so simple to work with that it makes it very tempting to just throw an example together, which ultimately might get people into bad habits of crafting their own (flask/django/requests/etc) oauth extensions rather than using carefully crafted ones. Good point, did not even occur to me. Closing.
