- it'd be good to add ""subject "" in front of the title [here](https://github.com/bcipolli/nilearn/blob/issue-446/examples/connectivity/plot_adhd_covariance.py#L98) because it's not clear what 0 means.

On my machine (mac), I also have  `n_jobs` as a parameter, and set it to one.  Parallel was crashing Python for me.

I think having `n_jobs=1`, with a comment about tweaking it (including limitations), could be instructive to users.

Or, could remove `n_jobs` and have an example that focuses on the parallel (and perhaps caching) aspects of the package, as kind of a mini-tutorial.
