also take a while).

As far as I can tell, the connectivity documentation is much greater, but info about the rest (MVPA, decoding, etc.) is now hidden / deleted.

I don't have the cycles to parse it all myself; would you mind to give a brief summary of where things are at:  specifically, I just want to know (very briefly) what's been deleted vs. moved vs. added.

For others, here's the big structural change (as far as I understood)
