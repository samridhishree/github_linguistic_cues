http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.jaccard_similarity_score.html

Overall, this kind of functionality, not strictly neuroimaging related, lives more in scikit-learn than nilearn.

What may be useful could be to add a function to do matching of 2 sets of maps, using sklearn.utils.linear_assignment. It should also be added to a nilearn example, for instance at the end of http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_compare_resting_state_decomposition.html, to plot the same map for both ICA and dict-learning.

6 subjects, and make 2 different sub-groups of 5 subjects, with only 10
components.

To make an example that is easy to follow, I think that you need
something higher level than just the Jaccard index. It's too low level,
and will lead to a lot of numpy code in the example. Maybe a function
that take 2 set of maps, returns a reordered version and a list of
similarities.

Scikit-learn implements the Jaccard Index in the specific setting of measuring clustering similarity. Here we have a fuzzy extension of the measure that will probably not be accepted in sklearn because there is no ""best"" way to make this extension. In particular, people in neuroimaging tend to use extensions that do not rely on linear assignment of the regions, see _Generalized Overlap Measures for Evaluation and
Validation in Medical Image Analysis_ (Crum 2006)

We then create atlases for both splits using CanICA and Dictionary Learning. Finally, we compute two Jaccard indexes: one between the CanICA atlases and one between the DictLearning atlases, to compare replicability between methods. The narrative would explain that we want our methods to be not only valid, but also replicable, and would give an intuitive explanation of the index.

I really like the idea of comparing two atlases map by map and trying to find a one-to-one correspondence, and I believe a lot of people would be interested in it.
