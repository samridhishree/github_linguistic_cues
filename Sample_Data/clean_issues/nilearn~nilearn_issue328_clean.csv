issue_title,328,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2014-12-19 15:07:03,"Great package here!

Not sure if I've done something improperly, but during both `pip install` and the development cloning process, I had dependency errors.  I came back and saw the dependencies and resolved them manually.

Rather than declaring dependencies in the `README.md` file, what about declaring in a `requirements.txt` file? ([documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide.html#requirements-files)).

This should allow `pip` to resolve dependencies when installing the package, and should make getting the development version after cloning `nilearn` up and running more easily.

I'd be happy to do this, if it sounds good!

We could also have defined the dependencies in setup.py. The thing is that for example numpy needs to be compiled from source when using pip install. This compilation step is likely to fail (for example because you don't have the package with the required C headers on Linux, or even more likely on Windows where most of our users don't have any C compiler installed) 

Basically we are strongly encouraging users to install numpy, scipy and scikit-learn via their OS package managers on Linux or Anaconda on Windows and OSX.

@GaelVaroquaux @AlexandreAbraham any other opinions?

Not much to add to what you said. That said, we should note that since
the alpha release, we have added the nibabel dependency in the
requirement file. So things will be a bit more streamlined in the next
release.

Time for an beta?

issue_comment,328,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2014-12-19 17:12:12,"Ok.  Perhaps having an explicit way to (a) install dependencies that play nice and (b) a way to error out the `pip install` of `nilearn` when they don't have `numpy`, `scipy`, or `scikit-learn` will help more novice  (installation-wise) users understand what's expected of them.

Glad to look into how to accomplish this in a `setup.py` file (sounds like a `requirements.txt` file may not be flexible enough to accomplish the above), if that sounds like a reasonable direction.

Maybe shooting a warning (or an error) in the setup.py would be a good
way to do this.

To do this, we should probably move the '_check_dependencies' out from
nilearn/__init__.py to nilearn.version and 'import' it in the setup.py as
the version number is currently imported.

I think that we would accept a PR (pull request) doing that.
Unfortunately, I'll be offline for 2 weeks starting tomorrow. So I cannot
review it, but maybe other people of the nilearn team will be able to.

I think the general idea has legs but needs to be tweaked a bit. The caveat is that you don't want to throw when nibabel is not installed in setup.py because setup.py is supposed to install it.

Also it'd be good to check what setup.py install error exactly looks like, to make sure we get an error that is actually helpful.

Good point. That means that you probably need to have a keyword argument
in the dependency checker.

Also, we should raise an error only if an install is asked, and not other
options.
