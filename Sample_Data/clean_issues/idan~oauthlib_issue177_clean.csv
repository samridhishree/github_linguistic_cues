issue_title,177,idan,oauthlib,masci,2013-06-08 13:02:47,"As stated in the RFC6749, during the refresh process the authorization server may release a new refresh token: in those cases (like mine) the old refresh token must be discarded. I am currently removing the old refresh token inside the validator (`save_bearer_token` method), so far so good.

To refresh a token I call `create_token_response` on a proper oauthlib server instance, thus triggering token validation in this order:
- client is authenticated
- grant_type is validated
- scopes are checked and validated calling `confirm_scopes` on validator
- `validate_refresh_token` is finally invoked

Now the issue: if the refresh token does not exists (either because already used or actually invalid) the error raised is `InvalidScopeError`, infact `confirm_scopes` method from my validator tries to load the refresh token from the db (failing) before the call to `validate_refresh_token`.

Am I missing something or the erorr raised is actually wrong in this specific case?

issue_comment,177,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-06-09 13:00:31,"The error is wrong since the token validation should come before scope validation. Fixed that now.

Also noticed that the error both on authentication and token was wrong. I've updated to

Invalid/expired/revoked refresh token -> InvalidGrantError
Authentication failure -> InvalidClientError

which should reflect the spec.
