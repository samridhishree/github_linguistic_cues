volume is computed from affine diagonal. This is making my extraction fails because my affine is
```Python
np.array([[0.3, 0   , 0  , -14.55],
          [0  , 0   , 0.3, -14.55],
          [0  , -0.3, 0  ,  14.55],
          [0  , 0   , 0  ,  1]])
```

What do you think about getting the volume information from `header.get_zooms()`",start issue,region_extractor.connected_regions gets zero volume from affine,volum comput affin diagon thi make extract fail affin what think get volum inform

I am curious about what is the purpose of an affine transformation with zero on the diagonal. Is an affine transformation with zero on the diagonal meaningful?",,,Hi I curiou purpos affin transform zero diagon Is affin transform zero diagon meaning

I would be in favour of changing min_region_size line to 
```min_region_size = min_region_size / np.abs(np.linalg.det(affine[:3, :3]))``` if it solves your problem.

As what we have did for ```connected_label_regions```",,,what specifi what size get return I would favour chang minregions line solv problem As
