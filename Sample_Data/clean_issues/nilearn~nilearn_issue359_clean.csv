There are a few issues preventing the setup script, code, and tests from running in Python 2.6:
- Trailing whitespace in `version.py` led to a setup syntax error.
- `""format_str{}"".format(str)` is illegal in Python 2.6; use `""format_str{0}"".format(str)`
- Dictionary comprehensions are NYI in Python 2.6; use `dict([list_comprehension])`
- Many `assert_X` functions are unavailable in Python 2.6; convert the few we were using to `assert_true`
- Context managers for `ZipFile`, `TarFile` don't exist in Python 2.6; wrap with `contextlib`
- Context manager for `nose.assert_raises` doesn't exist in Python 2.6; use our custom `assert_raises_regexp`, which was more appropriate anyway (since we wanted to check the error message of the error anyway).

I've also changed the `.travis.yml` file to contain a flow like `scikit-learn`.  The following three scenarios are now enabled:
- Python 2.6 under Anaconda install
- Python 2.7 using system packages
- Python 2.7 under neurodebian.

Tests for all three scenarios are working (or were working; seems the PGP key for neurodebian is choking at this moment, out of the blue)...

Have you check in sklearn.utils.testing. I believe that we have
backported everything that was necessary there.

Same thing, there is a fairly developed framework for testing assertions
in scikit-learn. We should rely on it, as these things are actually quite
tricky to get right.

Yeah this is quite annoying when that happens, not sure whether there is a way to work around it. I restarted the job on Travis and everything seems fine now.

For nilearn._utils.testing.assert_raises_regexp, I actually copied the code from scikit-learn. The main reason I did that is [there](https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/commit/a0c7693e0325dea9c7ce04a8512936eede881d32).

Good point, but supporting scikit-learn < 0.15 for users is different than supporting it for developers.  I think that, to avoid copying code and to use the full scikit-learn test functionality, it would be reasonable to require developers to use scikit-learn >= 0.15 (and show a meaningful error if they are not).

That doesn't seem to challenging to do... I'd be willing to make that happen if others are on-board with it.

Not sure where you would draw the line and which mechanism you would use. The thing is that Travis need to run the tests with old versions of scikit-learn so I don't really see how we can avoid providing an assert_raises_regexp inside nilearn.

Also as you might have seen from the link in my previous message there is a small but very nasty bug that is only fixed in scikit-learn master: assert_raises_regexp provided by scikit-learn is using match rather than search to check the error message. As far as I was concerned that was the last straw that broke the camel's back of my attempts at reusing scikit-learn assert_raises regexp.
