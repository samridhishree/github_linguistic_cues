issue_title,457,idan,oauthlib,hoylen,2017-01-10 06:57:58,"I installed _oauthlib_ 2.0.1 using the virtual environment support in the _pyCharm_ IDE. When running a short test program, I get an exception from _oauthlib/oauth1/rfc5859/signature.py_ line 473 where it tries to execute:

    import jwt.algorithms as jwtalgo

I've installed a module called ""jwt"" version 0.3.2 and that didn't solve the problem. Obviously that is not the JWT module it expects to be using, since it doesn't have an algorithms module.

**Which JWT module does _oauthlib_ depend upon**, because there's about 30 different modules available with the word ""jwt"" in their name!

It would be good if this was documented in the installation instructions.
