issue_title,71,aio-libs,aioredis,kernel0,2015-07-28 02:12:31,"Assume that there are task1, task2, task3 (Let's call that T1, T2, T3. and they use RedisPool) and self.minsize=1, self.maxsize=2 of Pool. (self.freesize = 1, self.size = 1)

While T1 acquired connection, T2 requests a connection to pool. (self.freesize = 0, self.size = 1)

``` python
    # Pool.acquire() -> Pool._fill_free()
    @asyncio.coroutine
    def _fill_free(self):
        while self.freesize < self.minsize and self.size < self.maxsize:
            conn = yield from self._create_new_connection()     <------------ (1) T2
            yield from self._pool.put(conn)


```

While pending T2 at (1), T3 requests a connection to pool and suspends at (1) and T1 release a connection. (self.freesize = 1, self.size = 1)
And then, T2 resume, acquire and release a connection (self.freesize = 2, self.size = 2)

``` python
    # Pool.acquire() -> Pool._fill_free()
    @asyncio.coroutine
    def _fill_free(self):
        while self.freesize < self.minsize and self.size < self.maxsize:
            conn = yield from self._create_new_connection()     <------------ (1) T3
            yield from self._pool.put(conn)                     
```

If T3 resumes, T3 tries to put a new connection to pool. However, T3 hangs until some task acquire connection, because it exceeds Maxsize of Pool.
