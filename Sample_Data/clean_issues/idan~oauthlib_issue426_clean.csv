issue_title,426,idan,oauthlib,macrojames,2016-05-22 16:32:29,"I am referring to #404 when I asked for colons to be removed from unsafe characters. 
A customer now referenced the rfc, it states only the query component MAY be encoded. 

I think the check is too harsh because it MAY be encoded. 
Also the protocol part :// does not require encoding. 

First request is: the test should only issue a warning and not raise an exception. 
Second it should only check the query component.
