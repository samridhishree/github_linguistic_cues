Exceptions are counterproductive: this function is used in things like
plotting for reporting. It's very counterproductive when the whole
pipeline crashes because of finding a cut. Hence, return [0, 0, 0] seems
like the right option. Possibly raising a warning (after all, if people
are nitpicky, warnings can be captured).
