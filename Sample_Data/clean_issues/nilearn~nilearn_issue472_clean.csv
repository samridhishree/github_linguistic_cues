But I don't think that we want to ignore any files in the code coverage.
I am quite happy to see that it's reported that they are not covered.

issue_comment,472,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-03-01 15:32:31,"My thinking was, by ignoring files that are not intended to be covered (like `examples` and `glass_brain_files`) would both improve the code coverage and show relevant files with poor coverage on the `coveralls` homepage (and maybe inspire some of us, including me, to look at the missing coverage!) :).  I tentatively included all `__init__` files, but that's probably to aggressive.

With that said, I'll have no objections if this is closed; I just assumed others would feel the same!
