issue_title,1092,nilearn,nilearn,MartinPerez,2016-04-24 10:17:54,"I find myself constantly segmenting atlases into lists of masks. Recently I had to extract ""again"" from a 3d niimg multiple ROIs given by an atlas (3d niimg with multiple labels) and thought that NiftiLabelsMasker could do the job. But NiftiLabelsMasker gives its own summary statistic and I needed all the features to do my own statistic on them.

Do you think adding this feature to NiftiLabelsMasker would be useful to others, so it could also work like a NiftiAtlasMasker? it would be simple to implement and I can take care of it.

The evoked option was to add an ""aggregator"" parameter that would be ""mean"" by default but could be replaced by any function. A bit like the ""scorer"" in scikit-learn.

Year, if you go region-by-region with one pass over your data using NiftiMasker, it will exactly give the regin-wise set of voxel-values. And then you can apply a custom pooling function on these selected features.
