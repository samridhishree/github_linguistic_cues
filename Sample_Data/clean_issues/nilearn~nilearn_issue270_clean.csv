issue_comment,270,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2014-10-29 15:51:38,"I'm not sure what to say about this... I think that the problem here is the ""continuous"" part (that should be ""nearest"" in your example). First, I think that reorder_img is a horrible name, reorder_axis would be more meaningful. Also, I don't see why a ""reordering"" function would completely change the affine.
I would split that into two low_level function: reorder_axis (or reorder_affine) and diagonalize_affine. And then, because diagonalize_affine would imply a resampling, then you don't need a ""resample_args"", it would be basically a wrapper around the resample function.

But to answer your question, if it is just about interpolation, I would go for a string parameter. `resample=True` would be equal to `resample='continuous'`. And you could put `resample='nearest'`. We could also imagine a `resample='auto'` which switches to nearest if all values are integers.

About using a string parameter, do we care about maintaining backward-compatibility where resample=True is equivalent to resample='continuous'?
