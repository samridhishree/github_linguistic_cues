I am a bit uneasy about calling it 'robust dispersion', because I don't
think that it maps to anything that has been published in the brain
imaging literature.

The terms that have been employed in the brain imaging literature to
denote this have been so far centered around the ideas of 'manifold',
'tangent' and 'riemannian'. I think that these would be 3 valid
suggestions for a naming. My favorite is 'manifold' because it is more
big picture, and because I can never spell 'riemannian' right.

So +1 for manifold on my side.

'tangent' is OK, as I think that it conveys the right idea. But in fMRI,
Bernard has been pushing forward Riemannian, and people in EEG too.
That's was I was thinking of 'manifold'. But I am OK with 'tangent'.

It's not about what suits me best, it's about finding what's best for the
future of this code.

Note that 'tangent' is quite fine with me. It's the vocabulary that I
tend to use in talks, or in my review paper with Cameron Craddock.

I think 'tangent' meets this goal and I prefer it to 'manifold', 'affine invariant' and 'Riemannian'.
Of course I am not fully satisfied by it since for me when I hear tangent I want to ask tangent to what. I am also not satisfied with 'robust dispersion' but couldn't come up with a better suggestion.

So +1 for 'tangent'

I remember trying to convince np.genfromtxt to return strings to no avail a little while ago.
