issue_comment,891,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2015-12-04 08:54:19,"In general, I am very happy to back the idea of a contributor wiki.

However, we should start by adapting the CONTRIBUTING.md of scikit-learn
to a CONTRIBUTING.md to nilearn. The reasons are 1) it gets displayed
github in the pull requests, 2) it is under version control, and can more
easily be curated and reviewed by core devs.
