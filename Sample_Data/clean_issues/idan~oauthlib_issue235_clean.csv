issue_title,235,idan,oauthlib,whitechris969,2014-02-28 08:15:35,"In the spec (http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2.2) it says that when you access the protected resource by including the token in the body (rather than the headers) you should only be able to do this through a PUT request, not GET. Also, there's a few other things. I'm able to do this:

```
response = requests.get(token_url,params={'grant_type':'client_credentials','client_id': client_id, 'client_secret': client_secret})
token = json.loads(response.text)
response = requests.get(api_url,params=token,headers={})
```

The important part being that I am putting the token in the body and issuing a GET request. Isn't this against the spec and shouldn't it fail?
",start issue,Accessing protected resources,In spec say access protect resourc includ token bodi rather header abl put request get also there thing Im abl the import part I put token bodi issu get request isnt spec shouldnt fail
issue_comment,235,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2014-03-20 18:34:35,"Yes it is against the spec and should fail or at least raise a warning. I don't think it is a security issue as much as GET requests should not have request bodies as they are usually ignored. Should still be fixed tho.

Thanks for reporting and investigating!
