I am trying to extract resting state network with Canica and/or Dict_learning from the Abide dataset. 
I chose the UM sample and downloaded the data after dparsf pre-processing (abide pre-processed).

When launching CanICA, I get a ""mask is invalid as it is empty"" error. 
As I didn't managed to extract the mask from the fmri images, I downloaded a mask for each subject from the abide repository and produced a mask for the dataset using Niftimasker. 
I created a list named ""mask"" with all the masks of the subjects and tried : 

`masker = NiftiMasker(mask_strategy='background', mask_args=dict(opening=8))`
`masker.fit(mask)`

and get  :

As the result was not perfect, I tried (even if the epi strategy should not be applied in this case because I am using a mask and not an fmri image)

`masker = NiftiMasker(mask_strategy='epi',mask_args=dict(upper_cutoff=.79,lower_cutoff=.77,opening=False))`
`masker.fit(mask)`
`plot_roi(masker.mask_img_, title='Mask-Nilearn')`

and get :

which is a little better. 

However the mask is not covering all the brain so I am wondering if I am using a correct strategy. 

Thanks a lot,

If you really want to compute the mask yourself, you could do a soft intersection of the masks of the different subjects, using http://nilearn.github.io/modules/generated/nilearn.masking.intersect_masks.html#nilearn.masking.intersect_masks

issue_comment,1275,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2016-09-15 11:58:46,"I saw with @medcharleslaidi today. The problem was that he was feeding in images that were already zero-meaned and variance-normalized. As a result, the mask extraction was failing.

To prevent this issue, we should do two things. First work on reporting: if @medcharleslaidi had been able to show us a report, we would have immediately diagnosed the problem. Second, we can add a warning in the mask extraction routines if they fail. It might prompt the user to look at their data. I have added #1276 as an enhancement issue on this subject.

In a group analysis, you probably want a standard mask that does not correspond to one subject in particular, but to the average of your sample. CaniCa does it for you (see Gael's response)?
