issue_title,100,aio-libs,aioredis,HaySayCheese,2015-12-06 01:16:55,"If timeout is specified - it will be ignored and, as a result, - the coroutine potentially will never be done.

Example:

```
await redis.blpop('non existent list', 10)
```

What should be done:
Coroutine should be unblocked after 10 seconds if list is empty or does not exists.

What really happens:
Coroutine continues to wait for list creation or first element.

issue_comment,100,aio-libs,aioredis,popravich,2015-12-06 11:39:43,"Please read docs carefully, the `timeout` parameter is keyword only, so the call must look like this:

``` python
await redis.blpop('non existent list', timeout=10)
```

in your case you wait for two lists: `non existent list` and `10`
