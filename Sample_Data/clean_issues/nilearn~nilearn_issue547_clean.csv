Can we add a function for plotting a connectivity matrix with the regions labels as the one in the example connectivity/plot_signal_extraction.html and with a colorbar ? I'm wondering if we can not put this function in _utils or plotting.

I am not against having a general matrix plotting function. I am just wondering if it is useful.
