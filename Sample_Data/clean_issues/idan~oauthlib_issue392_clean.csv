issue_title,392,idan,oauthlib,untitaker,2015-09-07 12:23:39,"I use `MobileApplicationClient` in a desktop application that doesn't rely on any other servers than the OAuth and resource ones. In order to avoid any token leakage, I instruct the server to redirect to an URI with a custom scheme, which is then catched by my application (which only can be done per-scheme). Something like the following redirect URI:

```
myapplication:access_token#access_token=...
```

Unfortunately, `MobileApplicationClient.parse_request_uri_response` doesn't think this URI is secure enough (since it's not HTTPS). But in fact it is more secure than having the OAuth server redirect to a third-party HTTPS server.
",start issue,MobileApplicationClient and non-https token redirects,I use desktop applic doesnt reli server oauth resourc one In order avoid token leakag I instruct server redirect uri custom scheme catch applic done perschem someth like follow redirect uri unfortun doesnt think uri secur enough sinc http but fact secur oauth server redirect thirdparti http server
issue_comment,392,idan,oauthlib,untitaker,2015-09-07 12:26:39,"The above example is only hypothetical, the actual usecase involves a command-line application which can't catch any URIs at all, while the server supports only one auth flow.
