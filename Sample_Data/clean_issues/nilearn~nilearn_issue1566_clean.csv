issue_title,1566,nilearn,nilearn,vukovicnikola,2017-11-20 17:36:08,"If I run a simple fit using, for example: 
```
cv = StratifiedKFold(n_folds=2,y=y)

decoder = SpaceNetClassifier(cv=cv, memory=""nilearn_cache"", penalty='tv-l1', memory_level=2, n_jobs=2, verbose=1, screening_percentile=20, mask= './mni_152_gm.nii')
decoder.fit(X, y)
```

According to the [Reference](http://nilearn.github.io/modules/generated/nilearn.decoding.SpaceNetClassifier.html),  there should be a decoder.alpha_ attribute. However, this does not exist when I inspect the decoder.

How to get the decoding accuracy without the best alpha from cv? Were there changes to SpaceNetClassifier since the reference page was last updated?",start issue,No alpha_ attribute in SpaceNetClassifier decoder,If I run simpl fit use exampl accord refer decoderalpha attribut howev exist I inspect decod how get decod accuraci without best alpha cv were chang spacenetclassifi sinc refer page last updat
