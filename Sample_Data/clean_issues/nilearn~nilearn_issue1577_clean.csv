issue_title,1577,nilearn,nilearn,grjd,2017-11-29 13:10:00,"Calculating the precision matrix for a group  of subjects via these two methods I get different results. First I just call GroupSparseCovarianceCV for the group  and in the second approach I do an average of the correlation matrix I got for each subject.
I wonder if it is any better to use LedoitWolf rather than Empirical covariance?
#approach 1  
>     gsc = GroupSparseCovarianceCV(verbose=2)
>     gsc.fit(time_series)
>     precision_matrix = -gsc.precisions_[...,0]

#approach 2 
> > ConnectivityMeasure(EmpiricalCovariance(assume_centered=True), kind='precision') 
> for i in range(0, len(time_series)):
>      correlation_matrix = connectivity_measure.fit_transform([time_series[i]])[0]
>      correlation_matrix_subjects.append(correlation_matrix)

issue_comment,1577,nilearn,nilearn,KamalakerDadi,2017-11-29 13:27:30,If I take your issue correctly there is already an issue #1460 on this. That may help to get more insights,,,If I take issu correctli alreadi issu 1460 that may help get insight
