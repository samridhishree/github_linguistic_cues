issue_comment,28,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2012-11-16 19:04:26,"There are many things that would be useful to add as tests. On top of my head ...
- Tests serve as great documentation, show off the different signature methods with tests, i.e. rsa and plaintext.
- Requests with application/x-www-form-urlencoded, ensure it affects the signature
- Requests with non application/x-www-form-urlencoded, ensure it does not affect the signature. For examples see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME_type
- Possible run over a set of sample ""real"" requests with more complex combinations of query params, headers and body than the usual basic test.
- Similar to the above would be to generate possible combinations of combinations with nonsensical but valid data and see if there are odd edge cases. 
",,,there mani thing would use add test On top head test serv great document show differ signatur method test ie rsa plaintext request applicationxwwwformurlencod ensur affect signatur request non applicationxwwwformurlencod ensur affect signatur for exampl see possibl run set sampl real request complex combin queri param header bodi usual basic test similar would gener possibl combin combin nonsens valid data see odd edg case
