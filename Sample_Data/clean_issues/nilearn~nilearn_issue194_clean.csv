Well, I am using it heavily right now, and finding that this design is an
error.

The behavior. This issue also made me think that we probably need to be
using *Masker.transform a bit more in the code.
",,,well I use heavili right find design error the behavior thi issu also made think probabl need use maskertransform bit code
