issue_comment,300,idan,oauthlib,lepture,2015-07-02 06:33:35,"If the response body is `''`, it means the response has no content. In this case, the HTTP code should be 204.

However, the spec defined the response with:

> The authorization server responds with HTTP status code 200 if the
>    token has been revoked successfully or if the client submitted an
>    invalid token.

The response code should be 200. Is it ok that a 200 response with no content? Would it be better to let the developer decide themselves?

Here is a quote from the spec http://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/wg/httpbis/specs/rfc7231.html#status.200

> Aside from responses to CONNECT, a 200 response always has a payload, though an origin server may generate a payload body of zero length. If no payload is desired, an origin server ought to send 204 (No Content) instead.

It has an uncertain statement:
