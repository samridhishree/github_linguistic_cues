Also, I suggest that we make ""affine"" optional in it: by default, the affine of the reference image would be used and we would check that the shapes of the data match.

Finally, I suggest that we change the signature to (data, ref_img, affine=None, ...), ie inverse the position of ref_img and data compared to the current situation. I find that it makes more sense.

If people agree with those changes, I am offering to implement them.

It's not going to happen any time soon. I have a lot of other urgent

+1 for exposing. Should take into account  #380 as best as possible.

Me too.

Same remark, I was planning to do a PR about that later.

> I suggest that we change the signature

I prefer to keep data and affine next to each other if possible, makes more sense to me. If we are to change the signature, I suggest that we change the name because I think of this function call as a sentence ""I want a new image like `param1` containing data `param2`"". And it would make less sense the other way around.
