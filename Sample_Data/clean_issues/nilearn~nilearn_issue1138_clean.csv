By default `dim=True` implies automatic dimming applies which makes contrast of the anatomical image weak. Some plotting functions are True and some are False by default. Any opinions on this ?

No, not because of crash. We opened because we noticed no effect even given beyond upper bound. May be we haven't noticed the slight difference in the display.

Ok. I will keep all plotting to dim='auto' since all use MNI template except for plot_epi and plot_glass_brain ?
