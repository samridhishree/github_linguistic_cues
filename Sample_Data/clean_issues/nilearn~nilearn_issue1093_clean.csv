issue_title,1093,nilearn,nilearn,cinvro,2016-04-28 01:00:37,"In this [example](https://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_adhd_spheres.html) on nil earn website, it says the coordinates of Default Mode Network are: [(0, -52, 18), (-46, -68, 32), (46, -68, 32), (0, 50, -5)]. 

I wonder where are these coordinates coming from? In what atlas/template? 

It seems that it's not the MNI coordinates according to [this paper](http://www.nature.com/ncomms/journal/v4/n1/fig_tab/ncomms2388_T1.html).
