I do a GraphLassoCV estimator for just 4 nodes and plot the covariance and the precision matrix, also Ledoit (which is pretty much like the precision)
The precision matrix (also Ledoit) dont recover the main diagonal, i should have maximum values for the diagonal, normalized or not.

lw_cov_, _ = ledoit_wolf(time_series)
lw_prec_ = linalg.inv(lw_cov_)
lw_prec_.precision_  gives me

It's the standard mathematical definition, with the corresponding
estimator.
