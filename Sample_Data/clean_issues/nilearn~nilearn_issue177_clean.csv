This is WIP because the following points still have to be addressed:
- provide an example (`plot_localizer_auditory(?)_mass_univariate.py`, ongoing)
- add tests for the downloader

What can be done by reviewers in order to help:
- check that the changes introduced in downloading tools are ok and not too specific.
- help finding good names to wrap Brainomics contrast names.
- help choosing the simpler caller functions that can be found at the end of `datasets.py`

For all these points I put more detailed comments below, directly in Github's code viewer.

If we adopt the conventions that have been suggested to me, ""right button press"" should be called ""right button press (auditory and visual cue)"". Eventually, we would have ""right vs left button press"" renamed as ""right button press (auditory and visual cue) vs left button press (auditory and visual cue)"", which is very long.
Actually, ""calculation (auditory and visual cue) + sentence listening and reading vs button press"" IS very long and unreadable. Besides, it cannot hold on one line, which makes documentation difficult to write.

Therefore, I dare insisting on the fact that I would like to call ""calculation"" the current ""calculation (auditory and visual cue)"" contrast. This will for instance simplify ""calculation (auditory and visual cue) + sentence listening and reading vs button press"" into ""calculation + sentences vs button press"". It also make us able to keep the name ""button press"", without needing to put ""(auditory and visual cue)"" afterwards for the sake of consistency.
