issue_title,170,idan,oauthlib,lepture,2013-05-31 03:25:31,"Add a debug mode with environment variable: `DEBUG`.

This is useful when doing the testing. Since I am using oauthlib's client to test the provider, everything is over http.

This patch will be helpful for testing.

issue_comment,170,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-05-31 09:04:08,"Can see this being useful. Could you add that to the two other https checks in parameters.py? And maybe extract the check into its own function? 

This should be added to the docs at some point too. I can do this when/if I decide to refactor part of the client API to be more consistent with the provider API.
