My point was the following; this functionally has remained unseen so 
far, how can we improve upon this ? My idea was to document this 
explicitly through example + documentation.
Please not also that actually no t-test is done here (""doing a t-test 
with nilearn is really something that we want to showcase"" ).

OK. Then I must say that I didn't understand the example.

I am thinking of one example that displays the same thing (eg a t-map
from the localizer) but with 3 different values of dim.
