Currently, it is not possible to properly use pylint on modules using .NET classes through Python.NET, as the imports fail. This is due to `modutils.find_from_modpath` essentially relying on `imp.find_module`, which does not work for this kind of pseudo-module.

I'd gladly work on a PR if one can provide me a hint on how this is supposed to be handled.

Python.NET is IronPython or it's different? I will be happy to assist you on a PR, but first I got to see why it fails. ;-)

No, [Python.NET](http://pythonnet.github.io/) is a library to import and use CLR assemblies like Python modules.

I don't know yet what the exact loading mechanism is, it's not exposed to Python, but it allows you to do stuff like `from System import String` to use .NET classes.

Probably we could fix this by adding AST transforms. Have a look at astroid.brain, there's a bunch of transforms that could be useful for inspiration. Adding support for this in modutils doesn't seem the right approach.
