issue_title,1088,nilearn,nilearn,alexsavio,2016-04-18 16:10:54,"Hi,
I have done a few nipype interface nodes that use nilearn and have plans to create more.
I would like to push these to nipype source in a month or two, when I have them tested and repeatedly used. 
I was wondering if you have any concern/comment or if you know of anyone working on this to join efforts.
One example is here: https://github.com/Neurita/pypes/blob/master/pypes/postproc/decompose.py
Thanks!

Nipype is useful for combining multiple tools, but it comes with inherent clunckiness due to that. Nilearn strives to make things simpler via its API.

Agreed. When I was using nipype heavily, I was mixing it a lot with
plotting (a bit like what's currently in pypreprocess)
