issue_title,900,nilearn,nilearn,TheChymera,2015-12-11 13:50:31,"I am trying to plot the `.nii` file located [here](http://chymera.eu/NIhelp/nilearn_plot0/6_restore_maths.nii.gz), with this script:

```
from nilearn import image, plotting

def plot_nii(file_path, slices):
    plotting.plot_anat(file_path, cut_coords=slices, display_mode=""y"", annotate=False, draw_cross=False)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    plot_nii(""6_restore_maths.nii.gz"", (-50,0,4,5))
    plotting.show()
```

The resulting image looks like this:
![figure_1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/950524/11745019/47a5207e-a015-11e5-869c-b0a977100131.png)

I have two issues with that:
- My image only has 14 coronal slices. Mapping the slices via some other unit of measurement (btw, what is it?) is annoying and unwieldy - as you can see, an increment of up to four displays the same slice, and then suddenly, via an increment of just one, I go to the next.
- The caudal slices are cut off at the top. Why? my data is not cut off like that (as you can see when plotting the image via FSLView or MRIcron.
",start issue,Plotting anatomical images,I tri plot file locat script the result imag look like figure1 I two issu My imag 14 coron slice map slice via unit measur btw annoy unwieldi see increment four display slice suddenli via increment one I go next the caudal slice cut top whi data cut like see plot imag via fslview mricron
issue_comment,900,nilearn,nilearn,danlurie,2016-04-30 22:51:00,"I agree it would be really useful to have the option of forcing Nilearn to take the header affine into account when plotting. 

Also useful would be a note to the plotting docs to at least mention the automatic interpolation. I'm happy to do this part, but it will have to wait until after the SFN deadline

issue_comment,900,nilearn,nilearn,MartinPerez,2016-05-03 14:48:06,"@TheChymera if I understand what you want. Then maybe you just need to do something like this?

```
# cutting on the x axis:
data = nib.load(img).get_data()
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, data.shape[0])
for idx, ax in enumerate(axes):
    plt.sca(ax)
    plt.imshow(data[idx, :, :])
plt.show()
```

does that help?
",,,thechymera I understand want then mayb need someth like help
