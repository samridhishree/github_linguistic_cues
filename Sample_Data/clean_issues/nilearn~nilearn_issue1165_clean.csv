Is there any reason we can not add one spatially preprocessed subject with its anatomical masks, host it on nilearn NITRC and use it to demo preprocs ?
It can be for instance a subject from the surgical epilepsy

Sorry, just suggesting, don't know how much this is relevant

issue_comment,1165,nilearn,nilearn,KamalakerDadi,2016-07-05 08:57:32,"You could also try this: `datasets.fetch_icbm152_brain_gm_mask` or `datasets.load_mni152_brain_mask` for a simple canonical mask.

Similar idea is proposed in Issue #1104 which takes gray matter mask for example and compute confounds and return the same from out of mask (white matter mask) depending upon the number of confounds user wants.

is that something you are planning for ?
