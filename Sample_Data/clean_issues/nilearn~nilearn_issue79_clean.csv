Can we use these in nilearn, or do these require preprocessing, or GLM
estimation that we cannot do in nilearn? If they cannot be used to write
a nilearn example, they should not be included in nilearn, but maybe
rather in pyprocess.

issue_comment,79,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2013-06-19 15:00:55,"> Yes they need preprocessing, just like NYU rest and openfmri for example.

Than they should probably go in Pypreprocess for now.
