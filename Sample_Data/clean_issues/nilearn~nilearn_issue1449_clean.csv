issue_title,1449,nilearn,nilearn,yavuzacikalin,2017-05-08 16:18:04,"Hello, 

I've tried to change the scoring of my searchlight analysis to area under the curve, and have tried various ways to input this, e.g.:

scoring = make_scorer(roc_auc_score)
scoring = 'roc_auc_score'
scoring = 'roc_auc'

In all cases, I get a ValueError, ""Data is not binary and pos_label is not specified"". From what I understand this seems to be an issue with the roc_auc_score function only taking 1's and 0's as input and not being able to read more ""flexible"" types of dummy variables. 

Any advice on how to implement this?

Thank you,

Before ```fit()```, convert input ""y"" to binary labels using ```_, y_labels = np.unique(y)```
Now, 
```python
searchlight.fit(fmri_img, y_labels)
```

Hope this way it helps.",,,defin searchlight estim like befor convert input binari label use now hope way help
