issue_title,502,idan,oauthlib,clancychilds,2017-11-18 22:44:54,"I have the case where an OIDC endpoint returns an `id_token` JWT which then needs to be passed to a /token endpoint using grant_type `urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer` as the `assertion` and then receive the resource access token.
From poking around, it looks like the ServiceApplicationClient is really close to this, but doesn't take into account the possibility that the JWT is already created (as it mainly works  to create the JWT itself).
If I was to work on this, what would be better:

1. Create a new Client class (probably just extending ServiceApplicationClient) that takes a pre-configured JWT? (What should I call this class?)
2. add a `jwt` parameter to the ServiceApplicationClient which, when it exists, would use that and bypass all of the JWT creation code

Or am I completely missing a better way to do this?",start issue,Allowing for already-created JWTs to be exchanged in JWT Bearer client flow,I case oidc endpoint return jwt need pass token endpoint use granttyp receiv resourc access token from poke around look like serviceapplicationcli realli close doesnt take account possibl jwt alreadi creat mainli work creat jwt If I work would better 1 creat new client class probabl extend serviceapplicationcli take preconfigur jwt what I call class 2 add paramet serviceapplicationcli exist would use bypass jwt creation code Or I complet miss better way
issue_comment,502,idan,oauthlib,clancychilds,2017-11-18 22:50:00,@ib-lundgren I believe you worked on the original ServiceApplicationClient implementation. Any thoughts on how you think I should proceed on working on this issue?,,,iblundgren I believ work origin serviceapplicationcli implement ani thought think I proceed work issu
