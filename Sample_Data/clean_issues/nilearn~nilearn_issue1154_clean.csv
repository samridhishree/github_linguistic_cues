issue_comment,1154,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2016-06-24 20:14:20,"So, the `cut_coords` parameter has always raised problems. For me, the main trouble is that `cut_coords` can take a parameter that is not a set of coordinates (ie the number of slices).

I am not in favor of adding a line in the doc because the distinction between (1) and (1,) is a very basic error in Python. My opinion on that is:
- either create a `n_slices` parameter. By doing this, `cut_coords` will never take an integer so therewill be no confusion
- or improve the error message. If an integer is given when `cut_coords` is waiting for a list, we can raise an error containing the line you've put in the doc.

issue_comment,1154,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2016-07-09 14:26:37,"Hi Kirstie,

I am still not convinced by the formulation. It gives me the impression that this is a special nilearn case, whereas it is just some Python basics. However, I am still not fond of the `cut_coords` parameter so I think that I am biased.

Can the doc gurus @banilo and @GaelVaroquaux decide on this point?

issue_comment,1154,nilearn,nilearn,KirstieJane,2016-06-24 20:45:26,"I think the most intuitive use would be to either pass an integer (I agree with @AlexandreAbraham that it's not ideal but I think the documentation is clear enough) or a set of (x, y, z) coordinates where you just wouldn't show the other two slices.

The two solutions that @AlexandreAbraham has proposed both require restructuring the code. The first because `n_slices` doesn't exist as an option (yet?) and the second because at the moment there is no error if you pass a single number in parentheses, eg: `cut_coords=(10)`. You simply get 10 images rather than the slice at (eg) `x=10`. You can't tell which input the user meant: the code runs, but at one point instead of three separate slices at `x=10`, `x=20` and `x=30` I got three images with 10, 20 and then 30 slices each!

If updating the doc string to make it usable to new adopters isn't acceptable then feel free to close the PR - I'm very sorry I didn't open an issue first! I didn't think adding documentation would be controversial.

issue_comment,1154,nilearn,nilearn,KirstieJane,2016-08-08 13:04:12,"My slow response this time @GaelVaroquaux! I think using a list makes sense. I don't feel confident editing the code to do that though - I had a look but I can't follow the code well enough to know that I'd caught all the locations in which it would have to be changed.

Sorry again for opening a pull request without an issue. Feel free to close this one!
