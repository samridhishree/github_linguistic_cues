issue_comment,281,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2014-10-16 08:54:23,"Sure. Think 303 makes more sense in the default case so could go ahead and
change all auth responses. I suppose we could even expose an easy way to
override this, either by using a auth_redirect_code member on the class or
through an extra validator method, e.g.

``` py
def authorization_response_status_code(self, response_type, client_id, request):
     return 303
```

Fancy creating a PR?

(Note to future self) The spec use 302 for all examples but is not mandated
and the code used is considered an implementation detail.
