After issue #59 the ""ability to optimize small ast subtrees, with the first use in the optimization of multiple BinOp nodes"" was added. We have a pylint checker that defines a visit_binop() to catch things like:
print 'a' + 'b'
print 'a' + 'b' 'c'
print 'a' 'b' + 'c'
print 'a' + 'b' + 'c'
The idea is to warn against explicit string concatenations. After v1.3.5 the last example comes as:
node.as_string() -> ""print 'abc'""
This means out visit_binop() is never called. This may be a problem not worth fixing but it is an issue nonetheless. Thanks.

Interesting use case.  A flag that disables the optimisation will help? Something along the lines of `manager.disable_ast_optimisation`, which needs to be set to True in your checker. Another solution would be for the peephole optimizer to obtain the joined string only if there are more than `n` nodes involved in the operation, but I don't think this one deserves the hassle.

In fact, it should be `True` by default and should be enabled only if the user wants to get rid of the maximum recursion depth problem.

A flag disabling it would solve the issue fine. That is what we (Google) will do internally to go around this problem anyway, so I see no problem in having a public mechanism to do this.

Add a new option to AstroidManager for controlling the AST peephole optimizer

The new option, 'optimize_ast', controls if peephole optimizer should be enabled or not.
This prevents a regression, where the visit_binop method wasn't called
anymore with astroid 1.3.5, due to the differences in the resulting AST.
Closes issue #82.
