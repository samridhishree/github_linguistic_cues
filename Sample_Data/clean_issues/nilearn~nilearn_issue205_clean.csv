issue_comment,205,nilearn,nilearn,eickenberg,2014-06-18 12:07:58,"To do:
- Add padding option to `fit`
- Figure out the resampling avoidal strategies (decision strategies needed, especially if we add padding)
- finish `inverse_transform`
- integrate this into an example
- design decision: If non-integer bounding box is passed, then we assume that resampling is wanted. Warn if `avoid_resampling` has not been set to `False`. This is because if you really want subvoxel sampling, you could make the voxels smaller in your affine.
- bounding box, if given to the constructor, must be specifiable in millimeter space instead of voxel space.
