issue_title,1111,nilearn,nilearn,cinvro,2016-06-08 03:53:50,"Does anyone have a chance to know the MNI coordinates for AAL atlas? 
Since the fetch_dataset_atlas_aal API returns no region_coords (MDSL has) for AAL atlas, so one cannot apply plotting.plot_connectome to visualize brain connectome in AAL atlas. 
Is there any alternative way to do so? 

I briefly searched the web, and I got [this](http://neuro.compute.dtu.dk/services/brededatabase/index_roi_tzouriomazoyer.html)
Is this the coordinates (the Mean coordinate in the bottom) for AAL atlas in MNI space?

Maybe, also, we should try to finish https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/pull/664

PS: @cinvro : you shouldn' be using the AAL, it's crap

It was done manually on one subject. Hence it is a very rough mapping of
brain territories. If you look at it, you'll see that it has many
straight lines, which does not reflect at all anatomy.

However, do you know any good alternatives?
