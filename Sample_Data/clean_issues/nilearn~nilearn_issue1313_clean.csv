issue_title,1313,nilearn,nilearn,Joaoloula,2016-10-17 18:39:07,"The docstring says the `subjects` argument in `fetch_haxby` is a list containing the subjects to be fetched, but it actually also accepts an int as argument, in which case it behaves as the deprecated `n_subjects`. This is problematic because in this case an unaware user can pass an int n as the argument and run  `haxby_dataset.func[0]`, which will return data for subject 1 instead of subject n. It seems to me that we should either:
- Make this use case explicit in the docstring or;
- Throw an error when `subjects` is an int.
