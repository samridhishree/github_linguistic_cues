issue_title,1510,nilearn,nilearn,grjd,2017-09-14 07:39:24,"I want to use scikit.cluster.Ward for group analysis. For one nii object it is straightforward to use the code bellow to fit one 4D object (""fmri_masked"") .
ward = FeatureAgglomeration(n_clusters, linkage='ward')
ward.fit(fmri_masked)
Is it possible to do Ward clustering for a list of objects, that is, rather than 1 fmri scan a list of them ?
