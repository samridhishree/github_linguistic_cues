https://github.com/GrahamDumpleton/wrapt/issues/64

Looks like astroid is failing in the python3.6-dev, relevant traceback is:

File ""/home/travis/virtualenv/python3.6-dev/lib/python3.6/site-packages/astroid/init.py"", line 60, in 
from astroid import raw_building
File ""/home/travis/virtualenv/python3.6-dev/lib/python3.6/site-packages/astroid/raw_building.py"", line 25, in 
from inspect import (getargspec, isdatadescriptor, isfunction, ismethod,
ImportError: cannot import name 'getargspec'

Look like getargspec is deprecated in python3.6
