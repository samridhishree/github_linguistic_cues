Almost all combinations of default settings have their advantages and disadvantages, but probably only on specific types of data. Maybe it would indeed be prudent to switch them off by default, e.g. if one assumes that many people will have their data already preprocessed in certain ways before using nilearn.

OK, I know why this is there, but it probably needs to be fixed (for
NiftiMapsMasker and NiftiLabelsMasker).

PR welcomed :). And thanks for noticing.
