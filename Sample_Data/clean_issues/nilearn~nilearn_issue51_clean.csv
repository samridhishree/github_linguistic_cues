issue_comment,51,nilearn,nilearn,pgervais,2013-05-15 12:58:07,"I merged the changes @AlexandreAbraham did to fix the documentation in my soon-to-be-merged branch ""roi"", and I stumble upon another problem: on the reference page for NiftiMultiMasker, the ""attributes"" section is empty (see e.g. http://nisl.github.io/modules/generated/nisl.io.nifti_multi_masker.NiftiMultiMasker.html), but there is actually something in the docstring. 

I investigating and found that there is an ambiguity in the way rst is interpreted. The part of the docstring causing the problem has the following structure:

```
Parameters
========
param1: type
    description
Attributes
=======
att1: type
    description
```

This can be interpreted in two ways: either as two sections, or as a table. Sphinx chooses the table. A key point is that ""Parameters"" and ""Attributes"" have the same length. Removing or adding a single character in one of the two make the problem disappear (but the section disappear in the generated output too, because the custom numpy-flavored rst parser expects a precise spelling). 

Is it a bug in numpy_ext? The problem doesn't seem to exist in the numpy documentation, as can be seen here: 
http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ndarray.html.
