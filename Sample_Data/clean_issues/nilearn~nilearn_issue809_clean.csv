I'm testing locally using a 64 bit version of python and also have the same ""OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long"" issue. This problem seems to be related to a call to joblib.Parallel in function ""permuted_ols"" that I don't fully understand.

I could hopefully fix the path related issues.

issue_comment,809,nilearn,nilearn,aabadie,2015-11-02 16:46:10,"I created PR #814 

Remaining issues:
- ""OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long"" raised in mass_univariate ""permuted_ol"" function. Some help will be greatly appreciated for this one.
- More problematic is the one concerning the access to multiple opened file at the same time on windows. For example:

``` python
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.txt') as fp:
    f = open(fp.name, 'w+b')
    f.write('toto')
    f.close()
```

will fail with the error message: """"""PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'C:\Users\ALEXAN~1\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpuuihk6z6.txt""""""
Same story with:

``` python
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.txt') as fp:
    with open(fp.name, 'w+b') as fpp:
        f.write('toto')
```

And this strategy is used intensively in nilearn/plotting/tests/test_img_plotting.py. I could fix the issue here using a temporary string variable and process the filename outside the ""with"" block.
But it's the same kind of context manager behavior used with the function write_tmp_imgs in _utils/testing.py to remove the temporary files on the fly. Here it breaks quite a few tests.

issue_comment,809,nilearn,nilearn,aabadie,2015-11-03 08:12:33,"@GaelVaroquaux, I agree. But now in the test (see test_img_plotting.py, function test_plot_anat), we use it like what I described above:

``` python
with tempfile.TemporaryFile(suffix='.png') as fp:
    z_slicer.savefig(fp.name) # savefig open another descriptor internally => permission error
```

Using the code below works (of course) but I need a confirmation of the solution:

``` python
filename = """"
with tempfile.TemporaryFile(suffix='.png') as fp:
    filename = fp.name

# tempfile has been removed when exiting the previous context
z_slicer.savefig(filename) # Opens and creates the file again
os.remove(filename)

I tried what @GaelVaroquaux suggested IRL without success. I also tried to remove the contextlib decorator and get the filenames using `list(write_tmp_imgs())` but then it breaks the initial test logic. I need some help on those ones.
