I think this is a bit confusing.

TODO:
* [ ] allow `await redis.set(..., exist='nx')  # case-insensitive`
* [x] keep current constants: `await redis.set(..., exist=redis.SET_IF_EXIST)`
* [ ] update docs adding parameters description",start issue,"update `set(.., exist=)` command to accept `nx`/`xx` parameter values",current accept two constant stand I think bit confus todo allow x keep current constant updat doc ad paramet descript
issue_comment,194,aio-libs,aioredis,argaen,2017-01-31 12:11:19,IMO a clearer way to do this would be reusing the `setnx` and `setex` commands. They are missing the TTL but internally they could endup both using the normal `set` command passing the options you said above.,,,imo clearer way would reus command they miss ttl intern could endup use normal command pass option said
