issue_comment,1302,nilearn,nilearn,aabadie,2016-10-04 08:59:09,"I could make it work on both python 2 and 3 by removing the encoding declaration `# *- encoding: utf-8 -*-` in `version.py` and using `io.open('README.rst/version.py', encoding='utf-8')` instead of the call to `open`.
Not sure if it's ok for you.

The error is : `SyntaxError: encoding declaration in Unicode string`

This is due to the fact that `version.py` starts with an encoding declaration `# *- encoding: utf-8 -*-`. No idea how to solve this though.

We could remove the first line on python 3, or add it dynamically for python 2, but neither sound great.
