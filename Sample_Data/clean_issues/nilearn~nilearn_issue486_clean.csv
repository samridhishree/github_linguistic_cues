I can reproduce the problem even when NILEARN_DATA is set. Here is the output:
- NILEARN_DATA no set:

``` python

In [1]: from nilearn import datasets

In [2]: datasets.fetch_harvard_oxford('cort-maxprob-thr25-2mm', verbose=10)
Dataset search paths: ['', '', '/home/le243287/nilearn_data']

```
- NILEARN_DATA set to /tmp:

``` python
In [1]: from nilearn import datasets

In [2]: datasets.fetch_harvard_oxford('cort-maxprob-thr25-2mm', verbose=10)
Dataset search paths: ['', '', '/tmp', '/home/le243287/nilearn_data']

```

In both cases for some reason `''` is inserted in the dataset search paths twice before the usual paths.

@banilo would make sense since you have worked on this fetcher in the past IIRC.
