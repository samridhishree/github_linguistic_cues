issue_comment,505,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-03-19 12:10:28,"So, I fixed the failing tests during lunch.

About the changes:
- 5D images or 4D masks are NOT accepted anymore (they were valid in a few functions)
- loading of 3D or 4D niimg is now explicit. A generic `check_niimg` exists (for 3D or 4D) is however present for explicit polymorphic functions (eg smooth_img)
- A lot of tests were totally wrong in their logic. We have to be more careful about what we test

I suggest that we merge the PR as-is.

Future work:
- `concat_niimgs` is a weird thing that accepts mix of 3D and 4D images. It shouldn't do that.
- Functions to load / iterate on list of niimg would be nice. For example `check_niimgs_3d` and `check_niimgs_4d` with optional parameters to check affines and stuff.
- This PR is only about clarifying difference between 3D and 4D as it was at the beginning (with niimg and niimgs). It does not fix #463 but it should fix #501.

I wanted to throw out this code that was in a branch for a very long time but i have no time to work on the other issues.

They already are. As said before, I don't really fix bugs nor add any functionality. I just fixed the fact that check_niimg (now check_niimg_3d) only loads 3D images and check_niimgs (now check_niimg_4d) only loads 4D images. It is true that, in the meantime, I removed the ability of some functions to handle 5d data, but NiftiMasker never did for example.

If we want to support 5D images, it is easy to do that in a lot of functions (smooth_img, reorder_img...). It can be done by modifying check_niimg to accept 5d data. Oh, and it may be possible to handle in MultiNiftiMasker rather easily.

Actually, we should grab some AFNI data to test it.
