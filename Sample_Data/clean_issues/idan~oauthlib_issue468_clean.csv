issue_title,468,idan,oauthlib,TizianoPerrucci,2017-03-08 09:58:49,"While integrating oauthlib with a Jython application we've found that Jython 2.7.0 has issues with `import *`.

This way of importing is in general strongly discouraged due to namespace pollution and unattended conflicts which could happen.

We've found only 3 occurrences of import * and we fixed all of them:
```
$ grep -R ""from .* import \*"" *
oauth1/__init__.py:from .rfc5849.errors import *
oauth2/__init__.py:from .rfc6749.errors import *
oauth2/rfc6749/clients/__init__.py:from .base import *
```

Please consider merging this PR and include in the next release.
