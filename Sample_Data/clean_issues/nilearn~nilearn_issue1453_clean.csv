Based on the issue #1371 we have here, I am not sure whether we should still rely on download link http://www.nitrc.org/frs/download.php/7700/HarvardOxford.tgz. Since, the atlases lying there are from old version 3.3. Added to that, there are few things which need to be changed in the fetcher. For instance, as said in the issue #1371, we should stop loading from local FSL.

These things are tried to be addressed in PR #1418 where it is not reviewed yet. So, may be I think we should wait to move on.",,,thank PR base issu 1371 I sure whether still reli download link sinc atlas lie old version 33 ad thing need chang fetcher for instanc said issu 1371 stop load local fsl these thing tri address PR 1418 review yet So may I think wait move
