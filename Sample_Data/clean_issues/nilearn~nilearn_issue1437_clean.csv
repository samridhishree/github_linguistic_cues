I have been using nilearn for a few weeks already. Actually, I need more technical explanation many times because I cannot figure out what a function does from the name of the function. For example, To understand what fit_transform function does in NiftiLabelsMasker, I had to read code. But if there were a little explanation like ""fit_transform calculates mean of the signal in the region"", I would not have to read the code.
",start issue,Improve docstrings: more technical details,Hi I use nilearn week alreadi actual I need technic explan mani time I cannot figur function name function for exampl To understand fittransform function niftilabelsmask I read code but littl explan like fittransform calcul mean signal region I would read code

I agree that quite often the docstrings could be improved. We're trying to work on it slowly. I think that you should feel free to send small PRs when you have a better version of a docstring.

I'll change the title of this issue to ""Improve docsrings: more technical details"", to make it easier to understand what it is about at a cursory look.",,,sorri repli long time I agre quit often docstr could improv were tri work slowli I think feel free send small pr better version docstr ill chang titl issu improv docsr technic detail make easier understand cursori look
