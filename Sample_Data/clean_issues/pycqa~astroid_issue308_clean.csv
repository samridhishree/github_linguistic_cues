It looks like the context normally provides protection against this sort of thing, but it isn't plumbed through to the check of the assignment.  Here's one possible fix.  I'm completely open to other solutions for fixing this since adding the context arg to a few methods does seem a bit invasive.  Maybe there's a cleaner solution.

Unfortunately I couldn't find the commit where this got fixed, but since 2.0 will become the new master in the next couple of weeks, I'm considering this fixed. Sorry for taking me so long to look over this issue and please let me know if it still reproduces for you on 2.0 (please note though that it is in an unstable test and pylint doesn't work yet with it)
