But the translation vector is hard to compute. Such a function is in
practice very hard to use. I find it counter intuitive to give a random
translation vector and then tell the function to ignore it. I find it
much more natural to not give a translation vector at all.

I think that this is a theoretical argument and that people haven't had
any difficulty using this code. It's success compared to alternative
resampling implementation tell us that the API is not too poorly defined.

We could have a separate function for 3x3 and 4x4 transformations, but a
lot of the code would be shared.

If this usecase is questionable, then the 3D target affine given and no target shape needs to be reexamined as well.

In any case, what nilearn was doing up until now, which is using the old shape of the functional file for the resampled image,  does not make any sense at all (cf the test I added in the first commit). So either we remove the optionality of the arguments target_affine and target_shape, or raise if affine 4D given and not target shape, or we make it do sensible things if some data are missing.

This should also be the case then for transformations with prescribed shape, in which case some refactoring of the decision tree in the function is necessary (this is the case anyway).

Another possibility we have is to warn if only part of the data will be visible in the positive orthant of the affine. This functionality can detect unwanted croppings, but may become annoying if cropping was intended. I would like to hear your opinion on this before making the changes.

All of these propositions are easy to implement - I just want to make sure I'm doing the right thing.

issue_comment,175,nilearn,nilearn,eickenberg,2014-03-21 15:11:45,"The beginning of the function regulates some cases:

target shape given but not target affine ==> raise
target shape given but not with exactly 3 entries ==> raise
neither target shape nor target affine given ==> return img or copy of img
if target affine is really close to affine and shapes identical ==> return img or copy of img

This leaves us in the situation where there is definitely a target affine given which is different from the current one. I'll now describe how things were, how they are now, and how I think they should be.

Status was: (Starting from l205, after the intro)
- if no target shape given, put original shape as target shape (<-- the useless behaviour we discussed)
- if affine shape is (3, 3), estimate bounding box, which includes estimating affine offset (origin) and shape (whether it is given or not).

So affine shape (3, 3) overrides target_shape = orig_shape whether it was specified or not

Status in PR:
- if no target shape given, then if affine shape is (4, 4), estimate bounding box sensibly, keeping origin defined by affine, and including all data that is in positive orthant of affine. Else set target shape to original shape (<--- this case will always be overwritten now)
- if affine shape is (3, 3) do what is done above

So here, as we see, even if temporarily target shape is set to original shape, it will never stay that way, so this branch should be removed.

My proposition:
- calculate bounding box of data under the new affine
- if 4D affine is given, then if any of the 3 max values of the bounding box is < 0, raise BoundingBoxException, because whether shape is given or not, none of the data will be seen, since none of it is in the positive orthant of the given affine.
  (- optionally: if 4D affine is given, and any of the min values of the bounding box are < 0, possibly warn that some data will be cropped)
- if 4D affine is given and no shape specified, calculate shape using bounding box
- if 3D affine is given and no shape specified, calculate shape and affine origin using bounding box
- proceed to resampling

One case is missing totally. What if 3D affine is given and shape specified? This should possibly raise an Exception, since we don't know how the user would like the origin placed ...
