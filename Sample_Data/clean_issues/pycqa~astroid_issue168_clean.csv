Here's a bug that describes a problem in astroid. If we're running pylint on it, then we'll get an error that 'str' has no member 'lala', while in fact it should have said about an integer
not have that member. What's happening is that astroid detects there's some monkey patching involved at some point and uses that newly patched method, disregarding any flow of the program.

```
#!python

class A:
    def action_type(self):
         return 42


def test():
   a = A()
   a.action_type = lambda self: 's'
   return a.action_type()

a = A()
print(a.action_type().lala)
```
