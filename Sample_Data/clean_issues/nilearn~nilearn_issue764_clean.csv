.... @GaelVaroquaux is alive.

More seriously: fetch_atlas_aal is good. People don't even realize that
there is an SPM version of the AAL.

issue_comment,764,nilearn,nilearn,MartinPerez,2015-08-21 12:48:55,"Originally I wrote fetch_atlas_aal. But I was told to make it more specific,  I guees if a new aal spm version is included, it would be as a separate atlas function. Actually the file structure is so different between versions that it might be better to just have them in separate fetch functions.

issue_comment,764,nilearn,nilearn,MartinPerez,2015-08-21 13:13:03,"ahhh, i really understood you wanted me to change everything, actually i was passing a version parameter at the beginning, I would completely agree with that, If you want I can implement the change, its a second... 

Then the parameter would be used also to create the dataset folder with the version attached, nonetheless I think it would be misleading for a user to have the parameter in the function exposed when at the moment there is no download of other versions, so maybe we would also need to point out in the docs that other versions are not downloadable yet?
