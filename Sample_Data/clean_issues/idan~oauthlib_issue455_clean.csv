issue_title,455,idan,oauthlib,bjmc,2016-12-20 22:02:28,"This changeset fixes a bug with the OpenIDConnect `prompt=` parameter that occurs in the second invocation of the `openid_authorization_validator()` during a POST to the authorization endpoint. If `credentials['prompt']` is already a list, then calling `split()` triggers an `AttributeError`

This is a deliberately conservative fix that just avoids trying to `split()` twice. It's possible that this bug points to a deeper problem with this approach (are we sure we should be splitting `prompt` when returning the `request_info`?) in the OIDC parameter handling.
