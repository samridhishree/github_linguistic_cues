I think I’ve found the cause of my error. There seems to be a bug in base_masker.py on lines 104-6. Instead of:

<pre>
            data[:, sessions == s] = \
                cache(signal.clean, memory, ref_memory_level, memory_level=2)(
                    data[:, sessions == s],
</pre>


Those lines should be:

<pre>
            data[sessions == s, :] = \
                cache(signal.clean, memory, ref_memory_level, memory_level=2)(
                    data[sessions == s, :],
</pre>


That’s because the 2D array is of shape samples-by-features. Therefore you need to index into the samples dimension with your sessions indices.
