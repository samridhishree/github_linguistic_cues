I realised that the np.asscalar wasn't needed at all in my case. Do you have a use case where it matters whether you have a list of numpy scalar arrays vs a list of floats?

Note that you actually return an array of shape (3, ) not a list. To be honest I am not sure whether there is any guarantee about the return type when the docstring says something like this:

```
Returns
-------
x : float
    the x world coordinate.
y : float
    the y world coordinate.
z : float
    the z world coordinate.
```
",,,I realis npasscalar wasnt need case Do use case matter whether list numpi scalar array vs list float note actual return array shape 3 list To honest I sure whether guarante return type docstr say someth like
issue_comment,452,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-02-21 10:11:43,"That was the use-case :)  Anotehr is checking to see whether a set of coordinates exists in a list (of lists).  I spent a good chunk of time today debugging matplotlib because of exactly that case--having the numpy object, rather than the actual scalar, broke the `in` check.

So when I saw this just now, it raised red flags.  You can get weird errors.

Also note that `tolist()` is called there, so it should be returning a list (and unpack properly).

issue_comment,452,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2015-02-21 10:19:59,"> having the numpy object, rather than the actual scalar, broke the in check.

Somehow it seems to work for me, not an expert of numpy scalar arrays though:

```
In [16]: l = [np.array(0), 1]

In [17]: 0 in l
Out[17]: True

In [18]: np.array(1) in l
Out[18]: True
```

I did miss that thanks for pointing it out.

issue_comment,452,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-02-21 10:48:37,"Cool.  I looked more closely, and apparently the issue wan't quite what I thought it was--only the final case causes a problem, which is not the case here.

``` python
>>> (1,2,3) in ((1,2,3),(4,5,6))
True
>>> (np.array(1),2,3) in ((1,2,3),(4,5,6))
True
>>> (np.array(2),2,np.array(3)) in ((1,2,3),(4,5,6))
False
>>> (np.array([1,2,3])) in ((1,2,3),(4,5,6))
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()
```

So no--no specific use-case.  Feel free to close (or to cherry-pick the linting)!
