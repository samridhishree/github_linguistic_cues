The initial test is quite robust to this effect, but not enough, at least on my box.
Using

rng = np.random.RandomState(1)

in the test solves the issue on my box, but I don't find it satisfactory.
Possible solutions are:
- test that the right subspace is recovered (instead of the right components)
- Make the fit more robust, by breaking the symmetry of the components (seems to work on my box).

Yeah, ICA is crap...

That's not really what we would like.

This seems like a good thing to attempt.
