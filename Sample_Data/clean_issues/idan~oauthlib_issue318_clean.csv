issue_title,318,idan,oauthlib,sabzo,2015-02-25 02:38:12,"I've read the entire docs, and done loads of research and my question is on this page: https://oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2/grants/credentials.html?highlight=create_token_response#oauthlib.oauth2.ClientCredentialsGrant.create_token_response

It's not too apparent if `create_token_response` is a method that's supplied and implemented by the library or are we actually creating the token generator?  If not then where do we define the datastore to save the tokens?

I see we implement the RequestValidator and use our own data stores, but for the preconfigured all-in-one servers how much do we implement ourselves?

Thanks in advance for the clarification.
