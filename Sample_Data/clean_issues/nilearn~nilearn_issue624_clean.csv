issue_title,624,nilearn,nilearn,banilo,2015-07-01 12:26:48,"I have raised a similar issue a while ago, yet I still believe that it would be convenient to add the possibility to perform some preprocessing on the `imgs` passed to `SearchLight.fit()`. As the fit function expects Nifti-like objects, it is not easy to manipulate each image individually or apply some overall statistic. This is especially cumbersome in data-rich scenarios as it might incur doubling the data to be fit.

Use cases:
- standardize BOLD images before passing them to SearchLight.fit()
- apply np.nan_to_num() to wipe out NaN's

Alternatively, one might always standardize the input data by default given that Max Kuhn holds that mean-centering + unit-variance scaling should never hurt but can often be useful or even necessary (particularly for SVM-based classification in our case).

issue_comment,624,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-07-03 09:13:39,"Searchlight belongs to the family of algorithm where signal from a structuring element is extracted and then processed. This is similar to `NiftiLabelsMasker`, `NiftiMapsMasker` and `NiftiSpheresMasker` (especially the latter). In #585, I started to factorize the code of these three objects but, as it is not the goal of the PR, I won't go further for the moment. Once this PR is merged, it will be easy to create a common function for all these objects and it will automatically enable the power of Masker\* options for Searchlight.

Is that good enough or do you need more?

Yes, passing on arguments to the internal searchlight masker (i.e., detrend and standardize) appears to be a viable solution. Good idea!
