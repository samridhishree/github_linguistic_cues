issue_comment,153,idan,oauthlib,lepture,2013-05-24 13:11:15,"@ib-lundgren I do think that it is not a good idea to put django and flask decorators in oauthlib. Oauthlib should focus on the core oauth part.

It's a time to move to the rfc instead of draft 25.

issue_comment,153,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-05-24 15:54:17,"@lepture I've begun to think the same lately which is why I am thinking about moving it out and into a new django-oauthlib project and instead of just a simple decorator let the project grow into a full fledged django extension. I've just not had time to set this up yet.

Regarding moving to RFC it certainly is time and I've only put it off because moving files around is boring and that OAuth 2 is split over so many more RFCs than just the core. For the sake of keeping with consistency we might want to split the draft25 folder into several RFC folders, Bearer, Core, MAC etc but not sure if that will just confuse things. 

@lepture Guess we could just start with draft25 -> rfc6749, is this something you would be interested in doing?

And I am designing the provider API right now.

I have not read all the RFCs, guess I need some time. Is there any big difference between draft25 and rfc6749?

AFAIK the spec has only changed in wording, not logic, between 25 and RFC so should not be much differences.

Regarding OAuth 1 I was planning on remaking the API to be very similar to the one of OAuth 2 (will track this in #95). You can always have a look at [flask-oauthprovider](https://github.com/ib-lundgren/flask-oauthprovider) and see if it is of any help (current, soon to be deprecated, api).
