issue_comment,102,aio-libs,aioredis,popravich,2016-01-12 09:00:46,"Hi, @pahaz 
It does not make much sense to change `@coroutine & yield from` to `async def & await` in readme.
`aioredis` support python3.3/3.4+ which has no native coroutine so, I guess, using `@coroutine` and `yield from`s is more verbose regarding support of those python versions.
