``` python
ast = parse(source_file.read())
ast == ast # True
ast == parse(ast.as_string()) # False
```

with the commented-out equality-checking code for ASTs in base.py enabled indicates that as_string() isn't preserving the invariant it should.  I've also tried parsing the same file twice and comparing those ASTs and that evaluates to True, so the problem is probably in as_string() rather than the equality code.
",start issue,as_string() is still buggy,run commentedout equalitycheck code ast basepi enabl indic asstr isnt preserv invari ive also tri pars file twice compar ast evalu true problem probabl asstr rather equal code
