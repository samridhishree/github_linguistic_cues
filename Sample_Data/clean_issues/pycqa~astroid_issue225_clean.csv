The current astroid cannot be installed with Python2 because `funcsigs` is misspelled as `funcigs` in `astroid/__pkginfo__.py`

Thanks for the report.  Are you trying to install using the @ bookmark/head?  The other bookmarks in the repository are under development and thus at any point may well be broken, but the @ bookmark should always point to a working changeset.  (If you're pulling and not getting all the bookmarks, something else is going on.)

It's embarrassing to admit, today is the first day I heard of bookmarks. I run ""hg pull -u"" regularly on the checked out repositories. I notices that hg complained of something ""non-linear"", so I forced the update. Then I could not install astroid. I could quickly find out the reason. Then I forked astroid to submit a pull request. But my fork does not have that issue, it's behind the original repository. As I understand, bookmarks are lightweight branches, and I got to an experimental branch accidentally.
