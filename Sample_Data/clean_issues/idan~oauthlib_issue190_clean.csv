issue_title,190,idan,oauthlib,masci,2013-07-08 21:28:07,"In oauthlib/common.py module is defined the set of characters considered _safe_ for url encodings.

Comma `,` is not considered safe but it's commonly used as id separator in url parameters. Since [rfc3986](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt) states comma is a _reserved_ character and since oauthlib treats other _reserved_ chars as safe:

```
urlencoded = set(always_safe) | set('=&;%+~')
```

could comma be added to the set of safe characters?
