issue_title,1521,nilearn,nilearn,grjd,2017-10-05 07:24:52,"Hi,
apologies if this is not the proper forum for making this question. I wonder if it is possible to compute the Ward clustering for a set of fmri images. In the [example](http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_rest_clustering.html), fit_transform computes the mask and extracts the time-series for one fmri nifti image. 
Is it possible to extract the time series for a set of images? 

```
#func_filename being a list with 2 or more images
fmri_masked = nifti_masker.fit_transform(func_filename)
```",start issue,ward clustering more than one image,Hi apolog proper forum make question I wonder possibl comput ward cluster set fmri imag In exampl fittransform comput mask extract timeseri one fmri nifti imag Is possibl extract time seri set imag

That should work (this is called a niimg in Nilearn jargon).",,,If question comput ward cluster replac input 4D imag list 3D imag that work call niimg nilearn jargon
issue_comment,1521,nilearn,nilearn,grjd,2017-10-06 09:38:10,"It is about Ward clustering for a list of 4D images, rather than 1 4D image an in the  [example](http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_rest_clustering.html)
Passing a list of 4D nifits as below doesnt work, guess as KamalakerDadi says need to do fit_transform in a loop for each image but then i would get a list of fmri_masked objects
```
nifti_masker = input_data.NiftiMasker(...)
fmri_masked = nifti_masker.fit_transform([4Dnifti1,....4Dniftin)
mask = nifti_masker.mask_img_.get_data().astype(bool)
```",,,It ward cluster list 4D imag rather 1 4D imag exampl pass list 4D nifit doesnt work guess kamalakerdadi say need fittransform loop imag would get list fmrimask object
issue_comment,1521,nilearn,nilearn,KamalakerDadi,2017-10-05 09:05:11,"As I mentioned in your previous issue #1510 . You can either use the WIP PR #1370 .
It is direct you just have to use define parameters for ```Parcellations``` objects and use ```fit_transform``` on list of images. ```fit``` will extract parcellations or ward rois. ```transform``` will extract timeseries signals.

Or

If you want to follow the existing [example](http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_rest_clustering.html), then it is also possible. Few steps are required.

You have to use ```NiftiLabelsMasker``` and give ward parcellations built on your fMRI images as input in parameter ```labels_img```.

Then, use ```fit_transfrom``` in a loop over each fmri image.

Example: of how ```NiftiLabelsMasker``` can be used is in [here](http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_signal_extraction.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-03-connectivity-plot-signal-extraction-py). But, you have to loop over the each fmri image.",,,As I mention previou issu 1510 you either use wip PR 1370 It direct use defin paramet object use list imag extract parcel ward roi extract timeseri signal Or If want follow exist exampl also possibl few step requir you use give ward parcel built fmri imag input paramet then use loop fmri imag exampl use but loop fmri imag
