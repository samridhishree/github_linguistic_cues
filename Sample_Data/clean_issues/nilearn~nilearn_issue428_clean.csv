issue_title,428,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2015-02-13 13:37:37,"The current documentation was built organically as the code grew. I propose a refactor of the structure, to make it easier to understand. Here are the notes and proposed layout from brainstorming with @banilo and @AlexandreAbraham :
# Introduction: nilearn, how and what for?
## Nilearn: MVPA and machine learning for neuroimaging

Here: define and relate to other things that people know

Set the problem, use the right words and give our added value

Right words: functional connectivity, parcellation, connectomes, MVPA, decoding, ...

Have a table/list linking sections of the docs to different modalities (VBM, Task, resting state)

Our added value:
- very simple (a few lines of code) access to advanced methods
- we scale (fast, memory usage...)
- we enable easy prototyping for experimentation and method development
- what we provide in the wider problem of learning on brain images is
  really feature engineering
## Installing nilearn
# Decoding: predicting from brain images
## An example
## Advanced methods
# Functional connectivity and resting state
## Extracting times series to build a functional connectome
## Extracting networks: ICA and beyond
## Clustering: learning a brain parcellation
# Image manipulation and visualization
## Plotting brain images
## Loading images and NiftiMasker

Explain here that the concept of loading images doesn't really exist in nilearn: you can just pass file names to functions. Define what a niimage is
## ROIs and masks
## Datasets integrated in nilearn
- Example datasets
- Atlases
# Advanced usage: pipelines and scaling up
## Example of a hand-crafted analysis pipeline
## Caching
## Multi-core: parallel computing

- Niimg-like description URL in a lot of docstrings
- installation instructions URL in the import error message in nilearn/version.py

There may be others, easy enough to git grep for nilearn.github.io.
