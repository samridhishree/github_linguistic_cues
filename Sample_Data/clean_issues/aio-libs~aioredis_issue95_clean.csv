Please let us know if you have plans to implement this functionality in near future.

Thanks.

issue_comment,95,aio-libs,aioredis,popravich,2015-11-04 11:26:48,"Hi, @devel787 
Well, it actually can be used with pool but you must remember that connection should not be released until all pub/sub operations are done.

This will work:

``` python
with (yield from redis_pool) as redis:
    ch, = yield from redis.subscribe('channe:1')
    while (yield from ch.wait_message()):
        msg = yield from ch.get()
        # ... process or start async processor or else
```

This **will not** work:

``` python
# When execution exits `with` block the connection is released and assumed to be free and available,
# so other pool users may acquire it and fail with ""Connection in SUBSCRIBE mode"" error.

with (yield from redis_pool) as redis:
    ch, = yield from redis.subscribe('channe:1')
    asyncio.async(reader(ch))

@asyncio.coroutine
def reader(ch):
    while (yield from ch.wait_message()):
        msg = yield from ch.get()
        # ... process or start async processor or else
```

issue_comment,95,aio-libs,aioredis,devel787,2015-11-04 14:36:02,"Hello, @popravich 
I have no possibility to use context manager in my code.

Is there some workaround?
Maybe `aioredis.RedisPool.acquire()`
http://aioredis.readthedocs.org/en/latest/api_reference.html#aioredis.RedisPool.acquire
can be helpful?
",,,hello popravich I possibl use context manag code Is workaround mayb help
issue_comment,95,aio-libs,aioredis,popravich,2015-11-04 14:39:35,"Yes, you can use `acquire` but don't forget to call `release` later:

``` python
redis = yield from pool.acquire()
try:
    ch, = yield from redis.subscribe('channel:1')
    while (yield from ch.wait_message()):
        msg =yield from ch.get()
        # process
finally:
    pool.release(redis)
```

Anyway, way can't you use context managers?

issue_comment,95,aio-libs,aioredis,devel787,2015-11-04 14:50:25,"I have some code, but have no clear vision how to refactor it for context manager usage.

Currently this code sample is deprecated, but main idea is the same

P.S. I also have a discussion (RU lang) about this code sample
