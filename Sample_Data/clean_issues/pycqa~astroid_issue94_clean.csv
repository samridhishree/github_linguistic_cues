We can do something similar for Generator nodes, as we do for Functions. Not sure yet what this will solve, except improving the inference engine.

This is blocking me from replacing the custom AST parser from MacroPy or doing other interesting stuff.

Except that it shouldn't be infer_call_result, because that's called when you're calling a generator, but some other method for retrieving the values a generator is yielding would be nice and helpful. If you want to discuss this, you can find me on #pylint on freenode on IRC.
