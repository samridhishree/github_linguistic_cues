issue_title,769,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-08-25 08:25:00,"In datasets, some atlases uses ""maps"" for the brain maps and ""labels"" for the name of the regions. For some atlases, we want to use ""labels"" for the brain components since the atlas is actually contained in a single label map but we can't because this would clash with other datasets.

I think we should follow the same convention for all atlases.

Also, I think that it would be good to always return a dictionary when we associate label values to names, even if they are integer. It is easier to use and more consistent.
