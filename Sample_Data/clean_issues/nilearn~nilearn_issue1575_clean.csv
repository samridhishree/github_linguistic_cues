issue_comment,1575,nilearn,nilearn,KamalakerDadi,2017-11-30 16:47:26,"I can see fixing this issue by adding a parameter wildcards=True or False (by default) and make use of helper function _resolve_globbing which is in nilearn/_utils/niimg_conversions.py.

_resolve_globbing should be called upon two usecases, one is when imgs are of list pattern [""*.nii.gz""] and str pattern ""*.nii.gz"". In former case, we should loop over the list and append all paths together and give to estimator. If agreed I can go for a FIX.

issue_comment,1575,nilearn,nilearn,KamalakerDadi,2017-11-30 17:05:22,"nilearn.EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS is always True and also controlled by other parameter wildcards. We do this only in check_niimg but new_img_like has nibabel.load. Moreover, as I said there is difference between resolving globs when given as list. check_niimg will give you single nifti image loaded. Please tell me if I am missing something ?
