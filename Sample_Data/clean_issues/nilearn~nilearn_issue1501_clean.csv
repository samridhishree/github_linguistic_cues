Maybe this functionality already exists or is in the works, but I haven't been able to find it.  If it does not yet exist, this would be a very cool feature to incorporate. I would think that these functions would be mpi-parallelizable across coordinates (i.e. the total runtime should theoretically be reducible to the length of time that it takes to extract signal from a single sphere/label assuming that number of coordinates = # cores?)",start issue,Accelerating the speed of NiftiSpheresMasker and NiftiLabelsMasker?,Is way speed niftispheresmask niftilabelsmask eg via joblib iter etc mayb function alreadi exist work I havent abl find If yet exist would cool featur incorpor I would think function would mpiparalleliz across coordin ie total runtim theoret reduc length time take extract signal singl spherelabel assum number coordin core
