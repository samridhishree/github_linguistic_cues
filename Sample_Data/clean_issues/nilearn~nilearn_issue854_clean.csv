Yet, `coef_` indicated that only a subset of the voxels was used, although `clf.screening_percentile` and `clf.screening_percentile_` showed the right value (100). There appears to be simple bug somewhere in the current master that ignores the user input.

That doesn't make sense. clf.coef_ should always have the same number of
features. The screening is inverted.

I am afraid that you'll have to share an example that enables us to
reproduce the problem, because right now it is guess work.
