issue_comment,754,nilearn,nilearn,eickenberg,2015-08-07 20:57:14,"Then maybe it is not applicable.

I understood that the transformer uses least squares to assign signal to
each ROI and that overlapping ROIs then have to share energy.

But one can also simply extract, and give the mean value. In that case, the
scaling, which was induced by the current transformer, would have to move
to the inverse transform.

I couldn't make sense of the code, so this remains the idea in my head.
Maybe I am wrong about how this works.

",,,then mayb applic I understood transform use least squar assign signal roi overlap roi share energi but one also simpli extract give mean valu In case scale induc current transform would move invers transform I couldnt make sens code remain idea head mayb I wrong work On fri aug 7 2015 1045 PM alexandr abraham notificationsgithubcom
