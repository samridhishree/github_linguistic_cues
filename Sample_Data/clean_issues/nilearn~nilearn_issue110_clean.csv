I think that we should expose it in the various nifti maskers and
probably enable it by default. SPM has the bad habit of putting NaNs
everywhere.

Indeed. What you are trying to do cannot and shouldn't work.

Well, first we can hack compute_epi_mask so that if the array has only 2
values it is well-behaved: take the largest of the two values, issue a
warning, and take the largest cc.

Second, we will need to implement a 'masking_strategy' option to the
masker.

Yes, agreed. We have been discussing add a 'masking_strategy' argument,
or something like this, to the NiftiMasker to cater for the multiple
options.

OK. Let's wait to see if it pops up in real life, and address the problem
when we have it.

issue_comment,110,nilearn,nilearn,banilo,2013-10-03 22:12:04,"Bonjour Bertrand,

Sorry, I didn't express myself clearly enough. In the attached file, you
will find a short piece of code that reproduces the bug (?):

loading an MSDL image (already binarized) by NiftiMasker results in a
NiftiMasker.mask_img_ that just contains a huge rectangle but not the
original MSDL region (dumped to disk as nii in the example).

I hope my report makes any sense :-) Let me know if I can be of any further
assistance.

Best,
Danilo

On my side, I see this: you have a binary mask that you are trying to fit and all you obtain is a big square. I've seen no Nan in your file.
First, you should simply feed the mask directly to the NiftiMasker: NiftiMasker(mask='MSDL_bin_0000.bin')

issue_comment,110,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2013-11-06 10:09:11,"I found the problem. The heuristic to compute the mask is the following: we take the histogram of the image, cut the first and last values, look at the highest gradient in the histogram and take it as a threshold. As your file has a very low number of activated voxels, it is cut in the first step. Fitting the mask on your binary data works if you set mask_upper_cutoff=0.99999 in the NiftiMasker options.

@GaelVaroquaux do you consider it as a bug ? I'm afraid that computing the mask could fail on very sparse fMRI (if only one ROI is aquired for example).
