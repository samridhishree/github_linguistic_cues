We should use a special node instead, so that the AST does not contain non-AST nodes.

Just define something that suggests that it's unknown. Maybe UnknownNode or something similar? This should be ignored by all other operations, such as inference or calling as_string on it. Also, it would be good to be in its own changeset, so that we can track better where it got changed.

This is closed by e956e29392a8 and 5fe25086c708, which adds the Unknown node with some stub functions and uses it for non-introspectable signatures.
