issue_title,830,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-11-06 12:42:11,"In #826, a user could not download an atlas because of SSL certificate verification error. He was probably behind a reverse proxy.

First, I think that we should favorize HTTP over HTTPS. I will make a PR to remove it where it is not necessary.

Second, it is possible to tell Python to ignore SSL verification. Should we do that? Ping @GaelVaroquaux .
