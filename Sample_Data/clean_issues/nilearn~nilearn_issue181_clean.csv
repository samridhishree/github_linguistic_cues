issue_comment,181,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2014-04-04 13:44:04,"I'd rather the high variance confound not be integrated in the
NiftiMasker, as ideally they should be computed on the non preprocessed
files and applied to the preprocessed files.

Computing non-specific confounds on preprocessed image is dangerous, for
instance, as pointed out by Basile on Tuesday, the global signal mean
will contain strong traces of the resampling done in the realign step.

In terms of software design, when we integrate the HV confounds, I would
like to do this in terms of a transform, but that means that we need to
change the design of nilearn to take dictionaries for X, and that's a
much larger design work that we will undertake later.

If you need it for your own codebase, for instance because you don't have
access to the raw data, I suggest that you sublass the NiftiMasker that
you are using to add the functionality in your codebase. It should not be
hard to do the subclassing.

OK, based on my experience it works better when using the raw data.

Anyhow, as long as we haven't a clear idea on these choices, I am not
very enthousiastic at the idea of making high-level objects. I would like
to get empirical validation of the pipeline before implementing it in
nilearn before I am worried about the combinatorial explosion of options.

I think that we have more to do before. I also think that we need to
change the way we pass information in and out of objects before we
tackle this problem.

hold.

In contrast, on postprocessed images they might also take into account variance introduced during the alignment process. Physiologically induced confounds should be available both before and after preprocessing the data, so not sure whether that should make a big difference.
