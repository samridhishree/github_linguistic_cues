I will reformulate what I understand for possible other users facing the same problem and may be you can correct me if I am wrong.

> It's not resampled, but it's aligned.

When plotting the edges, a rigid body transformation may be applied to the image. So if the images are different only through this 6 parameters transformation, edges will **perfectly** match.

I was overlaying a native functional by the edges of  a native anatomical for the same subject, expecting to see huge mismatch and it was not the case. I guess this 'realignment' made the edges seem acceptable to me. But when I compared after SPM coregistration I began to see **small** differences.
I guess the mismatch will be more pronounced when assessing normalization to the standard space.
