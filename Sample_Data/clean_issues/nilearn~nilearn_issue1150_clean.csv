issue_title,1150,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2016-06-23 17:49:41,"More and more people are asking for the ability to modify the svg template of the glass brain. For example, Pasteur's people want to plot ferret brains. I suggest that we may be able to set a global variable, or a shadow parameter to allow advanced user to change the template. I can show them how to hack it locally, the question is if we decide to propagate this change in the official repo.
