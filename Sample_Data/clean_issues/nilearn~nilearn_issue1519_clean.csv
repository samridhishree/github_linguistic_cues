I got many times trapped in signals extracted from unregistered atlas and functional volumes. Is there a reason why the default resampling strategy in the `NiftiLabelsMasker` is not `None` ?

issue_comment,1519,nilearn,nilearn,salma1601,2017-10-24 13:50:44,"It's for basic use. For mice data there is not yet a standard space (analog to MNI) to which people put their data. Many times I didn't pay attention to the space to which functional volumes were registered
and use an atlas/functional data from different spaces. But the masker resamples by default so I discovered very late in the analysis my registration problem.
``` Python
from nilearn.input_data import NiftiLabelsMasker
gm_masker = NiftiLabelsMasker(labels_img=atlas_filename,
                              mask_img=non_noise_mask_img,
                              detrend=True,

                              memory='nilearn_cache')

Yes but I wanted to understand the reason why the default strategy is to resample

issue_comment,1519,nilearn,nilearn,salma1601,2017-10-26 16:07:05,"> most use cases your assumption will not happen

Yes in the very standard and basic use case, say atlas in MNI and all volumes normalized to MNI, my assumptions will not happen and it is convenient to have the resampling done if needed. But many other use cases exist. For mice there isn't a unique popular standard space. Also for human imagine you want to extract time series in the subjects-spaces with atlas that have been transformed in these spaces, then any little mix in the files etc will just not be noticed.

Also, many people do (or not) their resampling at the end of their spatial normalization pipeline and would not expect a timeseries extraction step to impact the resampling so they can miss such an error.

Well, even in this case setting the default to None doesn't look bad for me. The user will bump into this the very first time, and then set explicitly `resampling_target='data'`. Why want the code to run with a user unaware of this necessary step ?",,,well even case set default none doesnt look bad the user bump first time set explicitli whi want code run user unawar necessari step

Resampling is done only when provided images have no same FOV. I think in a way it is right because most use cases your assumption will not happen.
