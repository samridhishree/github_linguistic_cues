issue_title,209,aio-libs,aioredis,pocek,2017-04-25 11:39:20,"It is rather surprising/annoying that e.g. `SortedSetCommandsMixin.zrange(..., withscores=True)` returns a flat list instead of a list of (value, score) tuples. Both python-redis and asyncio_redis return tuples which I think is much more sensible for a high-level API.

Current: `['a', 1, 'b', 2]`
Expected: `[('a', 1), ('b', 2)]`

Would a patch to rationalize this behavior be accepted? If it was a conscious design choice, one has to ask: why?

The proposal is more or less along these lines:
```patch
 def pairs_int_or_float(value):
     it = iter(value)
-    return list(sum(([val, int_or_float(score)] for val, score in zip(it, it)),
-                    []))
+    return [(val, int_or_float(score)) for val, score in zip(it, it)]
```",start issue,Set commands WITHSCORES should return tuples,It rather surprisingannoy eg return flat list instead list valu score tupl both pythonredi asyncioredi return tupl I think much sensibl highlevel api current expect would patch ration behavior accept If consciou design choic one ask the propos less along line

The patch would be appreciated, ofcourse with tests and documented notes on breaking changes.",,,Hi I think rather oversight review relat PR the patch would appreci ofcours test document note break chang
