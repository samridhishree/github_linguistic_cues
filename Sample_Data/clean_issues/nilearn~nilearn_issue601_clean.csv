I don't think that we dispute that there is a user error. The point is
rather that the error message is quite useless.

issue_comment,601,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-06-10 08:19:00,"I still think that there was a misuse of the function in the first place. Maybe the doc of `index_img` is not clear enough. After my PR, the error message is: `TypeError: Data must be a 3D Niimg-like object but you provided an image of shape (40, 64, 64, 1452). See http://nilearn.github.io/building_blocks/manipulating_mr_images.html#niimg.`

This is not the best error message but still better than the previous one.

issue_comment,601,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2015-06-11 04:04:28,"Wait. .. This is a very surprising error message. The question is not whether there has been a misuse of the function, but rather that the error message makes it hard to figure things out.
