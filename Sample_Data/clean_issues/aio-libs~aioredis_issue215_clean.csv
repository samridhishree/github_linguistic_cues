There's a new version of [pytest-xdist](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-xdist) available.
You are currently using **1.15.0**. I have updated it to **1.16.0**



These links might come in handy:  <a href=""https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-xdist"">PyPI</a> | <a href=""https://pyup.io/changelogs/pytest-xdist/"">Changelog</a> | <a href=""https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist"">Repo</a> 



### Changelog
> 
>### 1.16.0

>------

>- ``pytest-xdist`` now requires pytest 2.7 or later.

>- Add ``worker_id`` attribute in the TestReport

>- new hook: ``pytest_xdist_make_scheduler(config, log)``, can return custom tests items
>  distribution logic implementation. You can take a look at built-in ``LoadScheduling``
>  and ``EachScheduling`` implementations. Note that required scheduler class public
>  API may change in next ``pytest-xdist`` versions.
