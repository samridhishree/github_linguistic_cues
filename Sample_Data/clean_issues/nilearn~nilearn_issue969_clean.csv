issue_title,969,nilearn,nilearn,kingjr,2016-01-30 17:01:23,"Hi all,

Sorry if this is not the best place to ask this.

I am looking for an interactive MRI viewer in Python to semi-automatically locate intracranial electrodes based on a priori knowledge (respective locations, on cortical surface etc), and manual inputs.

Such viewer is standard in MRI packages:  3 views (x, y, z axes), similarly to `plotting.plot_anat()` but with some interaction: if you click on one voxel, the 3 views update their slice. 

I started a [gist](https://gist.github.com/kingjr/bb9e732fe8df6a8cd571), but it doesn't include all the nilearn viewing options (e.g. the xyz scales are in voxel units, not in mm)

I have tried to directly use nilearn plotting functions, but they seem to be strictly static, and I've encountered difficulties in finding a way to update an overlay, because I got lost in the display and slicer classes.

So in short, is the update of a MRI plot possible ? e.g.

```
display = plotting.plot_anat(fname, display_mode='x', cut_coords=[0], axes=ax)
plt.show()
display.update(cut_coords[10])
plt.show()
```

or even something like

```
brain_slice, extent = get_slice(anat, mode='x', cut_coords[0])
plt.imshow(brain, extent=extent)
```

Else, would it be conceivable? I'm happy to make a PR, but I'll need directions..

Thanks a lot for your help!
