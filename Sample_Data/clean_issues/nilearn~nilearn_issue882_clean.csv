I don't think so. The general idea with it is good. It's just that we are

I have to disagree on this one. I really don't see what this PR brings, sorry if I am missing something. 

Here is the picture in my mind: `check_niimg(..., return_iterator=True)` calls `_iter_check_img` as a helper function. `check_niimg(..., return_iterator=True)` supports globbing already, just use it.  

> I think that the trick is really to delay loading as much as possible, and it's easy to get that wrong with the checkers.

I guess if you are saying that the interface is not great, and you want to have a `iter_img` function, that is a valid point but then it should probably call `check_niimg(..., return_iterator=True)`.

No. _iter_check_iimgs does much more than that. It does resampling for
instance.

It's not a question about interface, it a question of how things fit
together. Looking at this single function and it's signature won't tell
us anything. We need to look at how it's been used.

I don't think is, because _iter_check_niimg has arguments that are unused
in check_niimg.

Anyhow, the fact is that _iter_check_niimg is called outside of
check_niimg by the MultiNiftiMasker. This in itself may be a design flaw,
but before sweeping the existing code under the rug, we need to
understand why it does that. One reason is that it uses those arguments
not exposed in check_niimg. There might be other reasons, or might not.
We need to assess this.

issue_comment,882,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-12-03 12:53:22,"What an atmosphere! Next time, use `git blame` and ping the guy who wrote the code :P.

The answers are really simple and lie in a fine distinction between what is a niimg and what is a list of niimg.

A niimg represents a single ""session"" (or a single atlas). A 4D niimg can be a single 4D nifti file or a list of 3D nifti files. If this is a list, all the nifti files should have the same affine, no resample is allowed.

A list of niimgs is a list of single sessions. Meaning, they can have different field of views, but this is acceptable and we can resample them.

Note that the mix between these 2 concepts (`niimg` and `niimgs`) brought a huge mess in the code before the last refactoring I made.

Now, `check_niimg*` functions will load single session nifti files. if a list if files is given, no resampling is allowed. To optimize some code here and there, people needed to iterate on the 3d scan of a 4d niimg at some point, this is why `return_iterator` is here. It calls `iter_check_niimg` for convenience but no resampling allowed, it will just check that the affine is the same everywhere.

In order to iterate on several subjects, such as MultiNiftiMasker, we want to allow resampling, this is why we call `_iter_check_niimg` directly.

I hope this is clearer now.
