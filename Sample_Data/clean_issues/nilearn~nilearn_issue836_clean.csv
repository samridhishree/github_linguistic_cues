issue_title,836,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2015-11-09 14:43:07,"The segmentation fault happens after running the tests. I was able to reproduce it on my laptop.

For now we don't install matplotlib on AppVeyor meaning that the plotting tests are not run. This was a stop-gap solution to get the AppVeyor continuous integration up and running.

A few of suggestions:
- try to install matplotlib with conda rather than pip. Full disclosure I had trouble when doing that on my laptop (unable to import matplotlib._png if I remember correctly), but it's worth a try.
- try to install different matplotlib/numpy versions to see whether the problem persists.

That would be great. Maybe report upstream on the matplotlib tracker, if
you can get a good reproducible case and a c-level stack trace.
