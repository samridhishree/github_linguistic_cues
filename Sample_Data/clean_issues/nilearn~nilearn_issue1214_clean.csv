Not really, no. It's going to make things more complex.

How exactly are you planning to do it? Maybe add a section at the end of
these example discussing this?

Can the ConnectivityMatrix estimator take this in account hidding
complexity from the user?

In fact there is a `ConnectivityMeasure(kind='partial correlation')` and `ConnectivityMeasure(kind='correlation')`. `ConnectivityMeasure` has also a parameter to handle any scikit-learn covariance estimator.
The only case which will not be handled directly is when `GroupSparseCovariance` is used: it outputs covariance and precision matrices, so in this case we need to use the functions `_corr_to_cov` and `_prec_to_partial` defined in `connectome.connectivity_matrices` module.

No, just replacing all uses of precisions and covariances by their normalized versions.
