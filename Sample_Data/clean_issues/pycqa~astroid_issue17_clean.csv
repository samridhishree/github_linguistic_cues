Hi there,

the attached script BuilderTests.py throws a TypeError

```
#!python

  TypeError: '_Yes' object is not iterable

```

when run through pylint (see attached issue.log for the full output), while the normal invocation with ""python BuilderTests.py"" shows the expected results.

Output of ""pylint --version"" is (installed from latest sources):

```
#!python

  No config file found, using default configuration
  pylint 1.1.0, 
  astroid 1.0.1, common 0.61.0
  Python 2.7.3 (default, Sep 26 2013, 20:03:06) 
  [GCC 4.6.3]

```

The given setup of classes and methods has a practical application, it's used in several unit tests for the build system SCons (www.scons.org).

Best regards,

Dirk
