issue_title,1539,nilearn,nilearn,salma1601,2017-11-05 16:03:40,"I am trying to illustrate the benefit of `LedoitWolf` vs `EmpiricalCovariance` in connectivity estimation, but when simulating multivariate Gaussian signals with a given true covariance I have the impression `LedoitWolf` underestimates the saliant patterns although the overall error is lower.

Example here with true covariance from fMRI data, left-right connections are on sub-diagonals
and deviate from true values more with LedoitWolf
