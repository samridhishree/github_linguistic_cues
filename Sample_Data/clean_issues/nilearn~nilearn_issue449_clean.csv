I have a change on my machine that does this, but I'm not sure it generalizes to all object types that the `axes` parameter could accept.  Note that the label actually has a grey background (i.e. it isn't transparent)

Not so advanced. People may copy-paste from the internets.
Why not setting the background of the _axis_ only to white or black? Advanced users will know how to revert it to another color if needed.

I honestly don't think that not handling figures with green background is a big drawback. But the rendering should be correct for default parameters at least.

Another compromise, different than the one above, is to remove the colored bounding box and move the labels a bit farther away from the brains, to avoid overlap in all reasonable cases.  

Indeed, I noticed that the padding of the bounding box is not very good above (note how the ""L"" touches the border of the brain), and in playing with that last night I settled this (bounding box still colored):

For me, that positioning looks better, and there is only label overlap with the brain at the very smallest (to me, unreasonable) sizes.  In that case, removing the colored bounding box seems reasonable to me.  Thoughts?

I agree it'd be nice to have better tests for plotting since at the moment we only have very limited smoke tests. I don't have a great suggestion for how to do that though. I meant to look at what matplotlib and seaborn was doing a while ago but I haven't got around to do it.

All of the plotting edge cases I'm looking at now, and things like print-to-PDF concerns, seems like important regression tests to verify before changing plotting code, but would slow down the Travis run.

There are other designs possible; for example, these types of tests could be implemented outside the `nosetests` framework.  That's just the way I've dealt with it in the past.  Very open to suggestions, but I do feel quite nervous changing plotting code without good regression tests to check that I'm not overlooking anything.

If they are not run on Travis, they will go under our radar when merging

I am very worried that adding the option to override defaults is going
overboard in terms of complexity for little benefits. This is going to be
of interest to a absolutely tiny fraction of users and it brings more
code lines, and more ways of putting the plotting code in corner cases,
and thus forcing us to add even more complexity. I think that we must
limit the amount of customization: after all, it doesn't bring that much
to the average user, who wants to do simple analysis and plotting of
data.

Unless I'm misunderstanding, even if they're run on Travis, and somehow we can show the image output, we'd have to remember to manually check that they ""look good"".  At least, I can't think of any automatic verification for the tests I'm thinking of (like, does the ""L"" label look good when the selected slice lines are nearby / intersecting?)

I agree, but this capability is already there--all of these functions take `kwargs`.  In my (admittedly uncertain) testing, this didn't work well for the existing functionality.

My real reason for doing this was that the args passed to the `ax.text` function was duplicated for `L` and `R` labels, and they got out of sync (one was passed with `alpha`, the other was not).  In refactoring that code, I noticed that switching the order of where `kwargs` was added gave the opportunity to override.  No need to even mention it, but it's there.

> it brings more code lines

I believe it actually reduced the number of lines and chances for real bugs, as the parameters passed for setting text are consistent between ""L"" and ""R"" labels.  Duplicating that logic elsewhere for consistency added 1-2 lines in 2 other places, but it's either a wash or slightly shorter overall.

No biggie either way to me.
