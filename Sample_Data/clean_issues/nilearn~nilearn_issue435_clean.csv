This seems like a great dataset for using machine learning to discover structure.  In fact, they ran a contest for best results so far, and the winner implements some algorithms that may be of interest.

modularized, would be a good basis for this?

That way, you don't have to maintain the code, but people like me can browse other examples (for example: if someone preprocessed datasets using nipype, then did machine learning in nilearn) and other code (like a generic openfrmi fetcher, if @schwarty has one or if I create one).

That would still take some maintenance, but I believe much less on your team, and potentially add a lot of value to users.
