The logic is that, hopefully, there are some common operations across the examples (because we tend to use similar datasets, and because we should as much as possible use default options), hence this should lead to speeding up the runtime of the examples.

You're going to fix that, though :).

I think that with the datasets we are very close to that limit. It's
actually a problem.

I really don't like creating files where users don't expect them.

The nilearn_cache folders get big in a non-controled way. We cannot
implicitely create them. I would like them to be always explicit.
