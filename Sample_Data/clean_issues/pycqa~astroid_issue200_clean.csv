Given the following code, astroid crashes with a KeyError. This is happening because Instance.getitem always wraps its arguments in a Const object, while sometimes it gets passed a slice object. It should use objects.Slice instead and probably it shouldn't do the wrapping itself, but the caller should be responsible for this.

```
#!python

from astroid.test_utils import extract_node
n = extract_node('''
class A:
   def __getitem__(self, k):       
       return k

A()[:42] #@

''')
print(next(n.infer()))
```

Don't wrap instance's arguments into a Const, instead let the original index object to be used.

This prevents a crash when the original index object is a slice object,
which was wrapped inadvertendly in a Const node, leading to a crash
later on if the said object was inferred. Closes issue #200.
