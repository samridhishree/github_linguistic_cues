Since https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/commit/3e27213914271309a4716662b09fda91fca9efa1,
is_subtype and is_supertype raise exceptions when they can't find a
relationship between types. This is caught by the callers of
_infer_binary_operation. However, the error is only thrown after the
generator return by _infer_binary_operation is started.

Prior to this patch, the generator is only started inside the else
clause of:

try:
    results = _infer_binary_operation(lhs, rhs, self, context, _get_binop_flow)
except exceptions._NonDeducibleTypeHierarchy:
    yield util.Uninferable
else:
    for result in results:
        yield result

generator when it's called, and then buffers that first result until it is
needed by the later iteration.",3179195b225baed9c27e774124ba3a5ba9269959,,quickstart inferbinaryoper rais error occur startup sinc issubtyp issupertyp rais except cant find relationship type thi caught caller inferbinaryoper howev error thrown gener return inferbinaryoper start prior patch gener start insid els claus tri result inferbinaryoperationlh rh self context getbinopflow except exceptionsnondeducibletypehierarchi yield utiluninfer els result result yield result To address quickstart decor pull first valu gener call buffer first result need later iter
