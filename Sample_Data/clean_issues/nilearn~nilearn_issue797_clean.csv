I was pleased (and surprised) to see that nilearn offers some apparently quite nice plotting functions (at least for human data). I am wondering:
- Why does it make sense to package these plotting functions together with functions better described by ni_learn_? Would it not be more intuitive (and perhaps make the plotting function modules more readily recognisable as such)  to package them as ""niplot"" or something of the sort?
- Is there any (more-or-less) easy way to plot some rodent data with the functions currently offered by nilearn?

Glass Brain was made by hand. Take a look at

nilearn/nilearn/plotting/glass_brain_files/*.svg

You will see that there are three vector drawings. If you can create these
for the main gyri/sulci of the mouse brain, you can have a mouse glass
brain.

So it depends on how much effort you want to put into it.

This has been discussed and the code is not mature enough to be separated from the core.

> Is there any (more-or-less) easy way to plot some rodent data with the functions currently offered by nilearn?

You can customize the background image used for regular plotting functions. For `plot_glass_brain`, the background template can be customized but it is not trivial for the moment.

What do you need exactly ?

Maybe just a 3D mask image and we compute the online of it (easy, just
compute the max along the direction and do a contour in matplotlib?

This would be open for contributions, but I don't see my team investing
in it in the short term, though, given how overcommitted we are.
