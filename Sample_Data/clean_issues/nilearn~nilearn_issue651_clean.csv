Not 100 % sure but I thought @GaelVaroquaux was of the opinion of not adding the scikit-image code in externals but rather only taking what we need and add it somewhere in nilearn.

If we decide it's fine to add it in externals then we should not test it. Adding a .coveragerc is probably the way forward in order to ignore files from the coverage (note you probably need to tweak continuous_integration/install.sh in order to copy .coveragerc where we are running the tests from)

handle it correctly without re-coding significant re-coding.

A simple way to extend the function for the case of non-isotropic voxels 
is to reproduce  the scipy.ndimage.maximum_filter API, where either a 
'size' or a 'footprint' is used.

numpy, or ConnectivityMeasure. In a sense, ConnectivityMeasure might
introduce less concepts to the user: the API is still a fit_transform.
