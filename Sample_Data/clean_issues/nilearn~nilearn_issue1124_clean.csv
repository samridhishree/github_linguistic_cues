issue_title,1124,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2016-06-12 10:35:39,"For building the docs, I propose to have ""make html"" create symbolic links to examples/nilearn_cache from all the example subfolders nilearn_cache directory (on unix systems only, of course). The goal being to federate the cache across all examples, in order to minimize computation.

This would be useful for CircleCI, but I suspect for all developers also.

What do people think?
