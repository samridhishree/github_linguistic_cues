issue_comment,418,pycqa,astroid,ceridwen,2017-04-03 21:26:50,"Sorry for the delay.  I've been trying to confirm or refute whether [stack introspection](http://pypy.org/performance.html#micro-tuning-tips) has anything to do with why PyPy runs pylint more slowly than CPython.  Currently, the only stack introspection we're doing is in `util.py`, calling `sys.exc_info()`when we reraise exceptions.  I haven't been able to prove that it's the problem, but I haven't been able to rule it out, either.  However, reraising exceptions is essential to getting useful tracebacks for debugging, so I've been looking for a better way to handle this that doesn't involve stack introspection.  So far, I haven't found anything that works with Python 2, which means this may be a permanent problem.

This makes me reluctant to add more stack introspection.    Regardless, we currently have clutter in our stack traces from `util.reraise()`, and I'd rather have clutter than introduce more stack introspection.

My only other comment is that because astroid is almost completely undocumented (this is a problem we inherited, unfortunately), it won't be apparent that `**kws` is only being used here to collect spurious arguments if something of the wrong type is being called.  Putting comments or docstrings in each function would be most transparent, but would require a lot of duplication.  Anyone else have a better idea?
