May be can you elaborate where these functions can be more useful to expose them ?
As I see it, one can use ConnectivityMeasure object easily to compute these measures.

issue_comment,1274,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2016-09-15 07:42:38,"The question is: Is there a usecase where we want to run these commands, ie where we grab connectivity matrices from somewhere else. I have mixed feelings about this. On one hand, these functions are simples, so there is no debate on the signature or usage, and I belive that making them public is harmless. On the other hand, I don't have any usecase in mind for that.

So, +0 for me.

> I thought about this in the context of the rationalization of the examples. The way that I see it is that we should introduce and advertise ConnectivityMeasure for group-level / multi subject analysis, but not when we are discussing single-subject analysis. It brings complexity but little benefits.

So that will allow to plot for instance the partial correlation coefficients, instead of negating the precision matrix. Negating the precision matrix assumes that people know the underlying relationship between precision/partial correlation.
