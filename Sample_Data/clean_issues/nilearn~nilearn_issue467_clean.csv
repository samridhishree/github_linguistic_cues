This is to detect missing files from the sdist. This generally happens
for data files in a folder without **init**.py.

Run the Travis tests from /tmp and use make -f instead of make -C.  make
-C actually cds into the directory before running make which exactly
what we are trying to avoid.

Any comments let me know, otherwise I'll merge that this afternoon.
