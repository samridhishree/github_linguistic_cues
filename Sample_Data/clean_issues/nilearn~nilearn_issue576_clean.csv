Unfortunately our plotting tests are a bit long, given that they involve a lot of matplotlib machinery. Thus we need to be careful here, and sometimes we will not test the full plotting function, but only the internal cutting one, if the cost in time is too much. Indeed, if the tests start taking too long to run, people won't run them anymore.

I am just asking an estimation of time, to know whether or not to include
it.
