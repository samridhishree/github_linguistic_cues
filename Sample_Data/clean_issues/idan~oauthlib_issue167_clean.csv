issue_title,167,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-05-29 14:36:06,"Remove oauthlib.oauth2.ext.*

The decorators while helpful in certain cases are not as useful as full blown extensions for respective framework. Furthermore OAuthLib is not the right place for them as it spreads the focus too much.

Django support will migrate to https://github.com/evonove/django-oauth-toolkit and Flask to https://github.com/lepture/flask-oauthlib.

The skeleton validator will be moved to a new extension as I complete it.

Docs should be updated to redirect users of known framework specific implementation to their respective project sites and to encourage people interested in adding support to new frameworks to get in touch.

The creating a provider docs will need to be updated to not use the django decorator. It should also encourage users to seek out framework specific libraries instead of using oauthlib directly.
