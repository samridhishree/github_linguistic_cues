issue_title,320,idan,oauthlib,djmitche,2015-02-26 22:20:40,"For example, `validate_authorization_request` and `create_authorization_response` pass around a thing that the code samples seem to call `credentials`, and which https://oauthlib.readthedocs.org/en/latest/oauth2/endpoints/authorization.html describes as a dictionary with four keys.  It actually has five (including `request`, the value of which is not JSON-able).

For a very security-sensitive library, guessing at the correct values to pass around here based on examples on stackoverflow feels _very_ wrong.
