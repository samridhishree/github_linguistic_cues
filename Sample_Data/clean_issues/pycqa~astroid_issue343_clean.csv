issue_title,343,pycqa,astroid,vfaronov,2016-06-29 14:17:41,"astroid’s [changelog](https://github.com/PyCQA/astroid/blob/master/ChangeLog) has not been updated for releases 1.4.2–1.4.6. I think it should be either maintained or dropped entirely.

Currently [AllMyChanges.com](https://allmychanges.com/p/python/astroid/) is set to track the changelog, which causes it to think that 1.4.1 is the latest release. If you wish to drop the changelog, I can reconfigure it to track PyPI instead.

issue_comment,343,pycqa,astroid,PCManticore,2016-06-29 14:28:28,"The changelog is maintained, although it contains entries from the minor releases, they were not put under a particular section. The changelogs from the minor releases have their Changelog properly updated. My plan is to write some day a script for automatically update the change log across the branches, but I didn't have time for this just yet.

I'm sorry, but the changelog is not going anywhere.
