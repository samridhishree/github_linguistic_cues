I think that you should use the stacklevel argument of warnings.warn.

pull_request_commit_comment,1247,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2016-08-17 13:10:14,"Returning an empty image was a good idea. Maybe you could do something like:

``` python
        input_img = new_img_like(maps_img, np.zeros(maps_img.shape[:3] + (0,))

If we do that, we will have a truly empty 4d image. However, this may break what happens next, for example if you try to plot it with prob_atlas. We have to think about it.

Plus, the length of `regions_extracted_img` and `index_of_each_map` should be the same, which is not the case with your current code.

I am not against returning special values in case of error to keep the pipeline running, but what you do here may be mlisleading for people.
