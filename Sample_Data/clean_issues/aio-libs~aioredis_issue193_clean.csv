issue_title,193,aio-libs,aioredis,joanvila,2017-01-30 19:16:05,"Hi team, the library is great! Good job!

I have a question which answer I cannot find in the documentation.

I have two situations which I don't know how to handle. The first one, I would like to do something like:

```
SET resource value NX PX 10000
```

NX for the `create if not exists` and PX for the `ttl`

The most similar way to do it that I have found is (assumming that `_connect()` returns a connection pool):

```
with await self._connect() as redis:
            await redis.set(""resource"", ""value"")
            await redis.expire(""resource"", 10)
```

The problem is that I cannot say if the set has the NX option and the two operations are not atomic. Is there a way to call a raw redis command through `aioredis`? If not, how can I achieve my goal?

My second question is if there is a way to run Lua scripts with the library.

Many thanks for your help and sorry if you have the information in the documentation and I didn't find it :)",start issue,NX and PX options,Hi team librari great good job I question answer I cannot find document I two situat I dont know handl the first one I would like someth like NX PX the similar way I found assum return connect pool the problem I cannot say set NX option two oper atom Is way call raw redi command If I achiev goal My second question way run lua script librari mani thank help sorri inform document I didnt find
issue_comment,193,aio-libs,aioredis,popravich,2017-01-30 21:58:07,"Hi,
There are two ways you can run `SET key value NX PX timeout` command:
* run `set` with keyword args: 
  ```python
  await redis.set('resource', 'value', pexpire=10000, exist=redis.SET_IF_NOT_EXIST)
  ```
* or run raw command using `execute` method:
  ```python
  await redis.execute('set', 'resource', 'value', 'nx', 'px', 10000)
  ```

Here is the [Lua-scripts related docs](http://aioredis.readthedocs.io/en/v0.3.0/mixins.html#scripting-commands)

Try these and return if you have any questions)",,,Hi there two way run command run keyword arg run raw command use method here luascript relat doc tri return question

I will try it when I have time but it looks great ðŸ™‚ . Do you think that we could add the NX and PX options to the documentation for future users? I you point me where I will be happy to submit a PR.",,,thank popravich I tri I time look great ðŸ™‚ Do think could add NX PX option document futur user I point I happi submit PR
