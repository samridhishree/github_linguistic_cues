issue_title,801,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-10-21 12:56:47,"Some neuropeople asked me why we were only plotting the right hemisphere in nilearn. In fact, in our plotting functions, in the sagittal view, the brain is ""looking to"" the right, which means that this is a right hemisphere to neuropeople. We probably want to flip it when the slice is in the left part of the brain in plotting and make two sagittal plots (one left hemisphere and one right hemisphere) in the glass brain.
