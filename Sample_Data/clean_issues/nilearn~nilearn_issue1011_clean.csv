- Not having ugly side effects at the beginning and of the acquisition (need to check this)
- Enabling missing data, as eg in a later possible implementation of scrubbing

issue_comment,1011,nilearn,nilearn,danlurie,2017-05-01 22:55:49,"Just encountered the Butterworth border effects in some of my own analysis. Nasty surprise until I realized what was causing the issue. I'm happy to add a note to the docs warning users about this. Where would be the right place to put this? With signal.clean only, or also with the Masker functions?",,,just encount butterworth border effect analysi nasti surpris I realiz caus issu Im happi add note doc warn user where would right place put with signalclean also masker function
issue_comment,1011,nilearn,nilearn,danlurie,2017-05-16 00:14:45,"I haven't to dug into the issues comprehensively, but one thing I have been able to replicate on multiple datasets (my own data and HCP) is that the filtering with `signal.clean` results in artificially low signal standard deviation at the beginning and end of a time series.

Here's the code I used to filter and regress out nuisance signals:
```
masker = input_data.NiftiLabelsMasker(labels_img=bna_img, background_label=0,
                mask_img=bold_T1w_brainmask, standardize=False, detrend=True, 
                low_pass=0.2, high_pass=0.01, t_r=2, resampling_target=""data"")
```",,,I havent dug issu comprehens one thing I abl replic multipl dataset data hcp filter result artifici low signal standard deviat begin end time seri butterworth weird here code I use filter regress nuisanc signal
issue_comment,1011,nilearn,nilearn,bthirion,2017-05-14 21:06:58,"This would be in signal.clean.
Can you show an exmaple of poor outcome of the Butterworth filter ?
Thanks,",,,thi would signalclean can show exmapl poor outcom butterworth filter thank
