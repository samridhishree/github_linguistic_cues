I think, this could be 1) tricky to newcomers and 2) requires incudling n=1 as a special case in script pipelines.

issue_comment,1280,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2016-10-25 18:20:58,"I really don't like special cases. They give imprecise semantics, and
lead to creeping bugs that get unnoticed. We used to have such special
cases in scikit-learn and removed them based on a general feeling of the
dev team.

The proper fix would be a better error message that suggests what is
wrong and proposes the newaxis solution.
