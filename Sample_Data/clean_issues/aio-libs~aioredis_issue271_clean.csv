issue_title,271,aio-libs,aioredis,popravich,2017-07-20 09:44:22,"Rationale:
* Get rid of bouble buffering (`data from socket -> asyncio.StreamReader.buffer -> hiredis.Reader.buffer`);
  our StreamReader can feed data directly to parser (hiredis or PyReader);
* Step over this issue — http://bugs.python.org/issue30861;

Some specs:
* must inherit from `asyncio.StreamReader`;
* `read...`-family functions should probably raise an error (RuntimeError);
* provide `async def read_response()` method waiting and returning either valid response
or raising an error (protocol error, canceled, closed, etc) (maybe some other method name);",start issue,Implement custom StreamReader,rational get rid boubl buffer streamread feed data directli parser hiredi pyread step issu — some spec must inherit famili function probabl rais error runtimeerror provid method wait return either valid respons rais error protocol error cancel close etc mayb method name

In any case, the new implementation will replace the official class provided by asyncio for a new one but the double step must remain there for many reasons.

are we in the same page?

Further, we could think in implement the Reader class - will become a bunch of code lines - in Cython. Theoretically, in an environment with `uvloop` and `hiredis` must speed up `aioredis`.
