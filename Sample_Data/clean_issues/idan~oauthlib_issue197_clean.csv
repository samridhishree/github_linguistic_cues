issue_comment,197,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2013-07-19 19:18:21,"@kdazzle Thanks for the PR!

I initially avoided the use of _create_request because earlier that implementation would cause this to fail because it also checked the request signature (which there is none during this step). It seems like this works well now tho and agree that an update might be in order.

Could you please also update the documentation with the error message thrown if oauth_token is not set on request.

Oh and feel free to push more changes to this PR.

Many bonus points if you add tests for this =)
