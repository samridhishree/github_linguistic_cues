issue_title,304,idan,oauthlib,artooro,2015-01-13 02:08:28,"See my question on stackoverflow.

My query to @oauth.token_handler contains the ! in the query string which resulted in a decoding error.

I modified oauthlib/common.py line 110 from:
urlencoded = set(always_safe) | set('=&;%+~,*@!)

to:
urlencoded = set(always_safe) | set('=&;%+~,*@!')

And that resolved the problem. I don't know if this is what I should have done, but it works. Can this fix be merged or should it be resolved some other way?
