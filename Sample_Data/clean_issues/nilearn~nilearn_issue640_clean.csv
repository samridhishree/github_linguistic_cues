The data download should be straightforward; there are good docs and examples from https://github.com/NeuroVault/pyneurovault . Just need to port things to nilearn's downloading framework, which I'm well familiar with.

Settling on a reasonable example is the most important thing. Glad to have suggestions, or to run with @chrisfilo 's idea of running ICA on some number of maps with DOIs.

OK. Great. It's good to have you in the loop. Keep us posted on this.

I really like his suggestion, actually. I think that it's a great example
of using nilearn (and maybe SparsePCA will give us cooler maps :P).

It's basically a pandas data frame, and you can do traditional filtering on
it, if the pyneurovault filter function is not suitable. Please post issue
for functionality that would be desired but is not yet offered!
