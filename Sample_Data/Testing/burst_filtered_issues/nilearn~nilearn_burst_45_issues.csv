5,issue_comment,240,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2014-09-15 13:53:52,"It seems like the the tests are broken because confounds is None by default in MultiPCA.fit so you have problem where you try to iterate in https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux/nilearn/blob/better_pca/nilearn/decomposition/multi_pca.py#L276.

That was already noted in
https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux/nilearn/commit/8448c7a3e3851395d91eff10c493c1a36d581119

I guess you could do something like:

``` python
if confounds is None:
    confounds = [None] * len(niimgs)
```

The merge conflict is very easy to resolve, in case that's what you were asking for.

For completeness, here is the traceback of one of the failing tests:

@lesteve : the problem that we are trying to solve is the usecase we a sysadmin install the data, or part of the data. Therefore there needs to be several layers of directories: one for the sysadmin, which won't be writeable by the end user, and one for the end user.
