1,issue_title,1244,nilearn,nilearn,Stef-aap,2016-08-15 20:08:14,"hello,

Probably I'm doing something wrong (different versions or so ?):

I'm investigating what I can do with Jupyter notebooks and came across some very nice looking notebooks from NiLearn, As I'm both new to Jupyter en NiLearn, this combination seems to be too difficult.

Already in the second code window< i ran into a bug: I had to change the last line

from nilearn import datasets, plotting
atlas_img = datasets.fetch_atlas_harvard_oxford('cort-maxprob-thr25-2mm')
# plotting.plot_roi ( atlas_img)

plotting.plot_roi ( atlas_img.maps )

The third code block contains at leat 2 erros, the first (masker=..), I solved but the second I'm lost (because indeed I can't find any file ""Background"".

from nilearn.input_data import NiftiLabelsMasker
# masker = NiftiLabelsMasker(labels_img=atlas_img)

masker = NiftiLabelsMasker(labels_img=atlas_img.labels )
# Now get the ADHD data

data = datasets.fetch_adhd(n_subjects=1)
# And apply the masker to the functional data

time_series = masker.fit_transform(data.func[0])

The benefit for it is outputting objects of the same nature for all kinds. I am having a hard time with the namings in my example, as I loop over all kinds

Ok
But even when I don't loop I don't like that we output things of different natures by the same object. I am not talking for math, it's rather for the reality. People have to be aware that the output of 'tangent' are not connections.
May be I am giving myself a headache, but I feel like this ConnectivityMeasure is not well done

13,issue_comment,1233,nilearn,nilearn,salma1601,2016-08-11 21:46:12,"Yes but its mean_ will not be a deviation !
I am back to the idea of adding an attribute
- at the fit, compute `connectivities_` which are the individual connectivity matrices, for `tangent` they are covariances -> to be plotted and watched, with a nice positive diagonal
- transform: this is transformation to vector space $R^p$, and for `tangent` this is the displacement who lives in the vector space -> to be used in statistical tests, and classification
- inverse transform: just back from vector to matrix, without any diabolic rescaling -> useful for p-values plotting

This is what seems the most natural to me, and the most easy to explain. I don't want to frighten people with deviations, I just want them to know what to input and what is their output

I think separating tangent is a good idea, and I am in favour of really changing the design of this ConnectivityMeasure. If I am stacked so much in the examples and the namings than I think there is a problem that can not be solved just by customizing the examples.

Again I am a humble user and don't know design, but I like your idea, so +1 for `BaseConnectomesEstimator` and `TangentConnectomesEstimator`

tangent_measure = ConnectivityMeasure(kind='tangent')
individual_deviations = tangent_measure.fit_trasnform(subjects, vectorize=True)
individual_connectivity_matrices = tangent_measure.inverse_transform(individual_deviations)
