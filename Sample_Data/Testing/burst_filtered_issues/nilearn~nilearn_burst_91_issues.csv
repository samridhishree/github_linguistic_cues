I am not feeling well today so I decided to go back home. Unfortunately, I will not get to see you again today. It was very nice to meet you. Thank you for your help! I wish you a great conference but an even greater holiday with your family.

Good point. Plots looks surprising. It is not failing with error but fails drastically in finding correct levels leading to masking out entire background.
For example,
