Yes, we should. We need to use our code, unless we have a released 0.15
version of sklearn.

The right way to compare versions in Python is:

<pre>
import sklearn
from distutils.version import LooseVersion
if LooseVersion(sklearn.__version__) >= LooseVersion('0.15'):
    #...
</pre>

Unfortunately, this will be true for '0.15-git', which is the version
string of the git version of sklearn. Therefore we will need to
special-case it :(.

Now that I think of it, I find it weird that I should put efforts on code robustness in a case were it is not supposed to be robust.

Actually the main problem is not my efforts, but the fact that nilearn's code has been made more complex in order to handle a use case that does not match the rules. Then, we violate the rule that says that we should keep our code the clearest possible. The latter rule looks more important to me.

But all this are details I guess.

But that's really a problem. Unless the data comes from a verified
source (eg the NIST statistical tables), what tells me I can trust it.

This is not a rhetoric question: in scipy people have worked in improving
the numerical stability of things like special functions. Tests like this
broke, but it was because the code was _more accurate_, not less
accurate.

We cannot just test against numbers that we don't know where they come
from and that we cannot reproduce. These are tests that will raise
problems in the long run.

OK, but then you do not want to implement it this way: it is too fragile.
Suppose you have numerical instabilities in the random number generator,
you'll get different streams. One should never rely on the fact that a
random number generator gives you a constant stream for the validity of
an algorithm.

Solution: pass the permutation as an argument to your function, instead
of the seed.

If this is what you think, please immediately close this PR so we will stop trying to make quality code together.
You seem so attached to recognizing your favorite conventions, and so eager to find it in my code that it completely blurred your understanding of what my code was actually doing.
All I wish is to respect conventions the best I can and I am not responsible if you spend your day fighting people that do not have this wish. So please remind that we are working in the same direction.

I am trying to tell you that `random_seed` has been set up to control the state of a routine which is supposed to rely on random numbers, especially for the sake of debugging, testing, and examples generation.
Here, the algorithm _requires_ that we _always_ have the control of the random numbers because they should be the same in simultaneous calls to the routine that uses them. It is not something I do for my pleasure, it is permutation tests theory that states that the F-max correction implies all the targets are permuted in the exact same fashion to enable comparison between them (finding the max).

I can put `random_state=None` by default, but then I would immediately assign it a fixed value in the first function instruction (yielding a fake impression to the code reviewer).

So:

> why? [renaming `random_state` to `seed`]

To avoid conventional people --that recognize a familiar name-- think that I did not follow the conventions whereas I was actually doing something different.

> what is the gain?

It becomes a compulsory argument, so that nobody uses the code without controlling the seed, and avoid making the mistake which whould consist of permuting chunks differently.

The big picture of what the permuted_ols code would become:
1. `permuted_ols` has a `random_state` argument that is defaulted to `None`
2. `rng = check_random_state(random_state)`
3. `seed = rng.randint(sys.maxint)  # the common seed itself is random, or controlled by `random_state` in examples and tests`
4. parallel calls to `_permuted_ols_on_chunk(seed, ...)`  (all chunks have the same seed, they cannot have a different one)
