![picture](https://nilearn.github.io/_images/plot_demo_plotting_7.png).

If there is a way to remove these regions automatically, it's probably worth doing. Something interesting to note, is that the values are pretty high (in this case very negative) and setting a high threshold won't make them go away.

Definitely a good idea to get some feedback from neuroscientists at one point in the future.

I would agree using only functions glass_brain.py is simpler. Having the glass brain plotting as part of the Axes makes sense but you need to jump through a few more levels (the `**kwargs` I added to a few methods [recently](https://github.com/lesteve/nilearn/commit/9909e211752197a844a18dd26043eb6792b8a5e0)). Other than that, there are still coord (axes level) and cut_coords (display level) in a few places in slicers.py which is a bit awkward given that it doesn't really apply to the glass brain use case.

> Next step is to add smoke tests, so that the test coverage is as high as possible (we aim for 90% or more).

Yep I started doing that but I bumped into errors I don't really understand yet.

Than I would be happy :).

The problem with precomputed values is that when things break a few years
down the line, it's harder to diagnose the break down, because you don't
know how the reference has been generated.

No, it only implies that end-users shouldn't be using it.
