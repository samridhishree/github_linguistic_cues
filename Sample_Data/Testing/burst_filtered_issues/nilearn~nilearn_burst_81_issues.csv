Ideally, the top 2 plots should be contours of the the bottom-most one, but it looks like the implementations we have use completely different heuristics (disclaimer: i haven't yet looked at the code).

We would need a tiny example demoing it.

Maybe you can do a new example in the plotting section that demos plot connectome and replace the image in https://circle-artifacts.com/gh/nilearn/nilearn/1495/artifacts/0/home/ubuntu/nilearn/doc/_build/html/plotting/index.html#different-plotting-functions by the image it generates (and link to that example).

I think that, for now, we could use a hard-coded set of coordinates and connectivity matrix, for instance inspired by: https://circle-artifacts.com/gh/nilearn/nilearn/1495/artifacts/0/home/ubuntu/nilearn/doc/_build/html/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_adhd_spheres.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-03-connectivity-plot-adhd-spheres-py

It would enable us to demo the hemisphere plotting for connectomes.

1,issue_title,774,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2015-09-03 21:44:00,"Careful timing / profiling shows that the dual-gap of the proximal
operator is sometimes decreased too far. As a result, the proximal
operator spends a lot of time trying to reach this dual gap, for no good
increase in overall energy. Profiling the code shows that this is the
number one loss of time.

Given that with warm-restart well implemented, decreasing on the fly the
tolerance of the proximal isn't very costly, we can rely fully on the
adaptative strategy, rather than on the paper of Schmidt et al (ie
implement FAASTA as in the paper). I have done this here. Printing values
of energies on the Haxby dataset shows that energy is decreased as well.

The code seems to be around 1.5 times faster.

I am sending a PR to see how this behaves on Travis / Circle
