No. It needs to be done in the following way:

<pre>
if img.dtype.kind == 'f':
   dtype = img.dtype
elif img.dtype.itemsize == 8:
   dtype = np.float64
else:
   dtype = np.float32
</pre>


this is to avoid at all cost using float64, which consume a lot of memory
and slow computations down.

We should implement a helper function in nilearn._utils.numpy_conversions
that does the above.

Should be in tests.

Yes, average.

Just don't catter for non CV stuff. In the nilearn codebase, the way to
do non-CV stuff will be to give a single value of alpha and l1_ratio to
the objects.
