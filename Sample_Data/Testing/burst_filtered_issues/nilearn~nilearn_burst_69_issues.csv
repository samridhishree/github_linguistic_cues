What's your scikit-learn version? I would have thought this would be fixed in scikit-learn 0.17.

Conda tip: not sure exactly why, but you need to explicitly specify dependencies in conda when using conda install with a specific version, e.g. something like:
`conda install numpy=1.9.1 scipy scikit-learn'

otherwise you'll keep scipy and scikit-learn compiled with whatever your previous version of numpy was.

I'm testing locally using a 64 bit version of python and also have the same ""OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long"" issue. This problem seems to be related to a call to joblib.Parallel in function ""permuted_ols"" that I don't fully understand.

6,issue_comment,809,nilearn,nilearn,aabadie,2015-11-02 16:46:10,"I created PR #814 

Remaining issues:
- ""OverflowError: Python int too large to convert to C long"" raised in mass_univariate ""permuted_ol"" function. Some help will be greatly appreciated for this one.
- More problematic is the one concerning the access to multiple opened file at the same time on windows. For example:

``` python
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.txt') as fp:
    f = open(fp.name, 'w+b')
    f.write('toto')
    f.close()
```

will fail with the error message: """"""PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'C:\Users\ALEXAN~1\AppData\Local\Temp\tmpuuihk6z6.txt""""""
Same story with:

``` python
with tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(suffix='.txt') as fp:
    with open(fp.name, 'w+b') as fpp:
        f.write('toto')
```

And this strategy is used intensively in nilearn/plotting/tests/test_img_plotting.py. I could fix the issue here using a temporary string variable and process the filename outside the ""with"" block.
But it's the same kind of context manager behavior used with the function write_tmp_imgs in _utils/testing.py to remove the temporary files on the fly. Here it breaks quite a few tests.

I had a hard time trying to understand what was the problem when computing the mean on 4D images being read from a file. I appears that the mean was computed on a memmap array as I already noticed, which could make the `np.mean` function return slightly different values.
I pushed another fix which consists in converting the memmap before passing it to `np.mean` using `np.ascontiguousarray`. This ensures the values are contiguous and the mean returns the exact same value.
Not sure the above is clear and also if this fix is ok.

- you have 2 `for` loops: one to fetch the files, one to load them. They can be merged.
- you have 3 for loops intricated for the 3 parameters. You can factorize that using itertools
- you generate a string for each item of the dataset. That mean that, if I want to have the matrices of dimensionality 20, I'll have to parse your string, which is inconvenient, you can use 3 lists instead.
- there is no reason to call `_fetch_files` several times since you only download one file

So I would write:

``` python
    dataset_name = 'Megatrawls'
    data_dir = _get_dataset_dir(dataset_name, data_dir=data_dir, verbose=verbose)
    description = _get_dataset_descr(dataset_name)

The problem is that your dummy file must be loadable by `csv_to_array` and empty files are not. You can, for exemple, replace the call of `csv_to_array` by `np.gen_from_txt` directly. You can also determine the filepaths that will be loaded by the function and make them non empty:

I was wondering whether we could not use a HTML redirect:
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5411538/redirect-from-an-html-page

This way we could have a shorter URL that fits on one line, say something like `http://nilearn.github.io/building_block/niimg.html`, and additional level of indirection in case this part of the documentation moves around.

Anyone who want to give it a try, be my guest!

I am trying to use `_fetch_files` to download the chunks of metadata, but the output of `_fetch_files` is making things tough.
- `verbose=2` is necessary to show the URL querystring (which I need to do; it's the only thing that changes from request to request), but it also outputs warnings if `total_size` is not set (which it is not). I need to suppress the warning but show the URL.
- After download, `...done` is printed to a new line. I find that messy and hard to read. I'd rather print on the same line as the download bytes.
- When a connection error occurs, I handle that and take care of things locally. However, I can't prevent a HTTP error from being reported, as well as ""dataset fetch aborted"". The error is re-raised in the code, so downstream functions have to catch anyway and handle--I think printing is unnecessary (either the exception is handled, or the same info will be printed to the console anyway).

I see three possible outcomes:
- `Update`_fetch_files` to be more flexible
- Use `requests` (which does more of what I want anyway).
- Use things as-is, and just have warnings & errors that need to be ignored by the user.

I decided to simply change `message`, rather than anything more complicated. We know the types of the errors, so we can be reasonably sure this will work.

If you look at the other commit (c59e5b8) I discarded, I actually made a function to do all the heavy lifting, so that it could be used for any exception. I abandoned it because it was going to be complicated--I wrote tests and everything :)

So, hard to answer your question: I'm going for the least-general / most-specific approach here, and it should work for these errors.

For @Leo-YF-Liu's particular example, 100% of standard brain = 0.044438533900526642% of **this** brain, leading to an essentially empty mask.

I think it's more natural to let `screening_percentile=100` mean 100% of **this** brain, i.e full-brain. Users can more easily make sense out of this.

Here are my conclusions:
- make -C doc check requires packages to be installed on the Ubuntu VM (12.04): dvipng.
- installing extra packages was broken on the VM but I could fix the issue by removing the conflicting latex package (texlive-binaries).
- I'm now trying the identify the missing packages in order to have the full doc check running.

As I had problems with circle-ci at the beginning, I also tried to run the doc check on travis and noticed a few things:
- I couldn't succeed because of the output limit (4MB) being reached by the full test suite (including doc test/check).
- At the beginning I reached several times the maximum resources provided by the legacy infrastructure of travis-ci. I gave a try to the container based one using : `sudo: required` in the `.travis.yml` configuration file. It works. The container infrastructure should be faster (that's what travis-ci claims).

The only reason we have to stick with the legacy Travis infrastructure is because we want to add neurodebian to the apt sources. For us to move the container-based one, we need Travis to add neurodebian to a white list. It hasn't happened and it is not clear whether/when it will.

Obviously you do need the

rather than
`nose.tools.assert_equal, fast_abs_percentile(data, p - 1), p`

to get the tests to pass.

To do:
- [x] Implement an API for downloading selected images from http://neurovault.org/
- [x] Create dataset documentation
- [x] Create a basic example for downloading a subset of files.
- [x] Create a more complex ICA-based example.
- [x] Create tests
- [x] Remove dependency on `requests` - use `urllib`
- [x] Read from disk when offline.
- [ ] Detect outdated cached collection or image metadata or data.

Neurovault contains images in collections. Collections can be filtered via a few querystring arguments. Images to download and return should be limited by filters on collection and image metadata.

To do this, I've included `collection_filters` and `image_filters` arguments.
- If `isinstance(collection_filters, dict)`, the filters are used as querystring argument filters.
- If `isinstance(*_filters, collections.Iterable)` (i.e. a list), the filters are assumed to be functions that receive a collection or image metadata, and returns `True` if the collection's images should be queried, or if the image should be downloaded.

The function returns a `Bunch` of three:
- `collections`: a dict (key: collection_id) of collection metadata for matched collections.
- `images`: a list of image metadata (including local file paths) for matched & downloaded images.
- `func_files`: a list of paths to downloaded files. Could be removed, but I kept it as many other functions return a list of paths to images.

The example I've begun with is a `stop-go` task meta-analysis, ported from:
https://github.com/NeuroVault/neurovault_analysis/blob/master/Stop%20vs.%20Go%20metaanalysis.ipynb

Note that I avoided trying to convert things to a `pandas` dataframe. The previous examples downloaded all images and filtered using `pandas`; however, all `nilearn` dataset fetchers filter before returning to the user. It was simple enough to allow lambda functions as filters to make very powerful pre-fetch filtering available to the user, so I went that route.

Looking for feedback on the overall API design to start. @chrisfilo and anyone else around!

I think that the macanism of filters is too complicated for most of our users. We can keep it for advanced users but at some point we should provide simpler pre-made filters. For example, I think that a user should be able to specify the id of a collection or a list of ids (I know that it's possible through collection_filter). But we'll see that later.

> The example I've begun with is a stop-go task meta-analysis

Reproducing an example provided by neurovault is indeed the way to go.

So far, we have avoided this dependency but we may have to include it at some point. Is there a real benefit to use pandas here?

Regardless of online or offline, there is an updating problem. When online, the code assumes that a cached copy of a particular collection or image metadata, or image data is correct / up-to-date. I have the `refresh` flag for controlling that behavior. A more automated mechanism is possible.

Separate from that, the code needs to work in offline mode; currently it does not. I have added that to the WIP item list.

Right; glad to add more simple filters. It's very easy to map from the simple filters to the more complex ones. The complex filters were needed to mirror the logic of the example I ported, but I could also change it to use specific collections and images (and tell users they were determined by searches on the website).

> So far, we have avoided this dependency but we may have to include it at some point. Is there a real benefit to use pandas here?

In the previous examples, the benefit was using Pandas' filtering mechanisms, which tend to lead to simpler code. But I just don't see it as an option here, unless we limit users to very simple filters (which I think would be a shame).

My main comment is that the examples are a bit scary. The fact that we come up with such examples suggests that we don't fully have the right abstractions. This is probably mostly unrelated with this PR (and something like https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/issues/847 might help). However, the current examples are going against the will of nilearn to reassure users that things are simple and will be alright.

I don't think so. The general idea with it is good. It's just that we are

I have to disagree on this one. I really don't see what this PR brings, sorry if I am missing something. 

Here is the picture in my mind: `check_niimg(..., return_iterator=True)` calls `_iter_check_img` as a helper function. `check_niimg(..., return_iterator=True)` supports globbing already, just use it.  

> I think that the trick is really to delay loading as much as possible, and it's easy to get that wrong with the checkers.

I guess if you are saying that the interface is not great, and you want to have a `iter_img` function, that is a valid point but then it should probably call `check_niimg(..., return_iterator=True)`.

No. _iter_check_iimgs does much more than that. It does resampling for
instance.

It's not a question about interface, it a question of how things fit
together. Looking at this single function and it's signature won't tell

I don't think is, because _iter_check_niimg has arguments that are unused
in check_niimg.

Anyhow, the fact is that _iter_check_niimg is called outside of
check_niimg by the MultiNiftiMasker. This in itself may be a design flaw,
but before sweeping the existing code under the rug, we need to
understand why it does that. One reason is that it uses those arguments
not exposed in check_niimg. There might be other reasons, or might not.
We need to assess this.

The answers are really simple and lie in a fine distinction between what is a niimg and what is a list of niimg.

A niimg represents a single ""session"" (or a single atlas). A 4D niimg can be a single 4D nifti file or a list of 3D nifti files. If this is a list, all the nifti files should have the same affine, no resample is allowed.

A list of niimgs is a list of single sessions. Meaning, they can have different field of views, but this is acceptable and we can resample them.

Note that the mix between these 2 concepts (`niimg` and `niimgs`) brought a huge mess in the code before the last refactoring I made.

Now, `check_niimg*` functions will load single session nifti files. if a list if files is given, no resampling is allowed. To optimize some code here and there, people needed to iterate on the 3d scan of a 4d niimg at some point, this is why `return_iterator` is here. It calls `iter_check_niimg` for convenience but no resampling allowed, it will just check that the affine is the same everywhere.

In order to iterate on several subjects, such as MultiNiftiMasker, we want to allow resampling, this is why we call `_iter_check_niimg` directly.

I hope this is clearer now.

random Matrix should be to the concatenation of twice the same random

Fair enough, but it's not obvious from a cursory look that this is what
is happening.

If it's indeed the case, we need to fix the test to check only for the
leading eigenvalues (for instance by extracting only a small number of
components).

Randomized svd perform the computation:
- `data.T.dot(np.randn((n, k+10)))` (ref case) vs `data.T.dot(np.randn((2n, k+10)))` (tile case) if `transpose = False`
- data.dot(np.randn(p, k+10)) if `transpose = True` in any case

The random matrix `Q` is different for ref case and tile case if `transpose=False`. It does not mean that we should put `transpose=True` as this is less efficient : on the other hand, if we choose not to, we need to adapt the test. in sklearn < 0.17, `transpose` was always `True` (bug fixed by @giorgiop), hence the bug. `n_iter` has no influence on our test, but it defaults differently in different sklearn, so we should force it in nilearn IMHO.

Hotfix is easy, I'll provide it. Them we should redesign the test in order to test only on leading components.

My PR to this branch solves this problem, to the cost of doing things a
bit more manually. However, I think that we should accept this cost, in

No, that wasn't enough to limit the memory explosion, it just delayed it.

I suspect that images spanned by the iterator were not properly garbage
collected. But it does require investigation.

I'm trying to use the searchlight object, but I need to have access to the scores_ maps for each fold of the cv... Starting from the haxby example, I tried to modify the code as follows by removing the cv argument and the looping over the cv object (scikit-learn style):

``` python
for train_index, test_index in cv:
    # define train and test datasets
    fmri_img_train = index_img(fmri_img, train_index)
    fmri_img_test = index_img(fmri_img, test_index)
    y_train = y[train_index]
    y_test = y[test_index]
    searchlight = nilearn.decoding.SearchLight(
        mask_img,
        process_mask_img=process_mask_img,
        radius=5.6, n_jobs=n_jobs,verbose=1)
    searchlight.fit(fmri_img_train, y_train)
    searchlight.predict(fmri_img_test)
```

but there's no 'predict' method... then I read the doc of the searchlight class, and it says that if no cv is given, it does a 3-fold cv... so I'm stuck now!

Any clue on how to do this?

Thanks,

I have a pretty good idea about how the searchlight object works, I'm just specifically focused on how `searchlight.scores_` is computed, given the earlier comment in this thread where ""_from what I understand, the searchlight.scores_ map is the average of the maps I'm looking for_"" (@SylvainTakerkart) was followed with a direct reply stating that ""_searchlight.scores_ map is not computed that way_.""

`par_scores[i] = np.mean(cross_val_score(estimator, X[:, row], y, cv=cv, n_jobs=1, **kwargs))`

Not 100 % sure but I thought @GaelVaroquaux was of the opinion of not adding the scikit-image code in externals but rather only taking what we need and add it somewhere in nilearn.

If we decide it's fine to add it in externals then we should not test it. Adding a .coveragerc is probably the way forward in order to ignore files from the coverage (note you probably need to tweak continuous_integration/install.sh in order to copy .coveragerc where we are running the tests from)

handle it correctly without re-coding significant re-coding.

A simple way to extend the function for the case of non-isotropic voxels

Correlations are enough. I am wondering: which code is simpler: using
numpy, or ConnectivityMeasure. In a sense, ConnectivityMeasure might
introduce less concepts to the user: the API is still a fit_transform.
