This happens because the first loop to compute the shape works fine but the second loop to set the data never gets run because the iterator has already been consumed in the first one.

I think your comments are related to sphinx-gallery and not nilearn. I reckon we should merge this PR. The alternative is for your comments to be addressed in sphinx-gallery and a new sphinx-gallery release to be made before we can merge this PR. This seems a little bit too much overhead for what it is worth IMHO.

Just for clarity we'll try to keep the sphinx-gallery copy inside nilearn in sync with the latest sphinx-gallery release going forward, which means that if your comments get addressed in sphinx-gallery they will eventually reach the nilearn sphinx-gallery copy.

Using float as numpy array indices is deprecated indeed as the following snippet shows so feel free to open a separate PR with this change
