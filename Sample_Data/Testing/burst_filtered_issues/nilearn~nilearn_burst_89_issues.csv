I assume this is because nilearn does not explicitly set the matplotlib backend as `agg`. Can you confirm that this is indeed what is causing the error? Since nilearn does not depend on gtk (and I believe rightfully so) I think the test phase should not fail if there happens to be no gtk support in matplotlib.

If you look at the file `nilearn/plotting/__init__.py`, you'll see that we have some code to use the `agg` backend if no sidplay is available. I guess that somehow this code is not working properly on your machine. Could you:
- tell us how you launch the test suite so that we can reproduce
- try to copy/paste the code in the beginning of init and then check that the backend has been switched to `agg` (using `matplotlib.get_backend()`)
- check that you don't have a maplotlib.rc file in your current dir on anything at python loading (maybe an `ipython_config.py`) that pre-set a different matplotlb backend (because in that case, nilearn cannot reset it).

As a reminder, the code to be run:

``` python
def _set_mpl_backend():
    try:
        # We are doing local imports here to avoid poluting our namespace
        import matplotlib
        import os
        import sys
        # Set the backend to a non-interactive one for unices without X
        if (os.name == 'posix' and 'DISPLAY' not in os.environ
            and not (sys.platform == 'darwin'
                     and matplotlib.get_backend() == 'MacOSX'
                     )):
