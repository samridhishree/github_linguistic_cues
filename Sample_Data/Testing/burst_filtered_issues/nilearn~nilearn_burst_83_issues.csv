- examples relying on haxby_simple must be updated
- we should probably discuss if we remove it bluntly or if we ""deprecate it"" (and make it rely on fetch_haxby)
- the test of haxby_simple is the only one to actually ""download"" a file (it is a dummy file from the repo itself) and therefor to test the full dataset fetching process. We have to replace it by another one (can be done in a separate PR).

1,issue_title,832,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-11-06 23:00:16,"This is an enhancement for #640. Not quite done, but far enough along to talk about the API I've implemented.

To do:
- [x] Implement an API for downloading selected images from http://neurovault.org/
- [x] Create dataset documentation
- [x] Create a basic example for downloading a subset of files.
- [x] Create a more complex ICA-based example.
- [x] Create tests
- [x] Remove dependency on `requests` - use `urllib`
- [x] Read from disk when offline.
- [ ] Detect outdated cached collection or image metadata or data.

Neurovault contains images in collections. Collections can be filtered via a few querystring arguments. Images to download and return should be limited by filters on collection and image metadata.

To do this, I've included `collection_filters` and `image_filters` arguments.
- If `isinstance(collection_filters, dict)`, the filters are used as querystring argument filters.
- If `isinstance(*_filters, collections.Iterable)` (i.e. a list), the filters are assumed to be functions that receive a collection or image metadata, and returns `True` if the collection's images should be queried, or if the image should be downloaded.

The function returns a `Bunch` of three:
- `collections`: a dict (key: collection_id) of collection metadata for matched collections.
- `images`: a list of image metadata (including local file paths) for matched & downloaded images.
- `func_files`: a list of paths to downloaded files. Could be removed, but I kept it as many other functions return a list of paths to images.

The example I've begun with is a `stop-go` task meta-analysis, ported from:
https://github.com/NeuroVault/neurovault_analysis/blob/master/Stop%20vs.%20Go%20metaanalysis.ipynb

Note that I avoided trying to convert things to a `pandas` dataframe. The previous examples downloaded all images and filtered using `pandas`; however, all `nilearn` dataset fetchers filter before returning to the user. It was simple enough to allow lambda functions as filters to make very powerful pre-fetch filtering available to the user, so I went that route.

Looking for feedback on the overall API design to start. @chrisfilo and anyone else around!
