12,issue_comment,59,nilearn,nilearn,pgervais,2013-05-23 16:25:22,"Some more changes.

The img_to_signals_*() functions now always output as many signals as regions. Having a array size known in advance will make downstream code simpler to write.

I added some debugging messages to both Nifti(Maps|Labels)Masker object, putting at least something behind the ""verbose"" option. I created a mixin just for this, comments welcome, as usual. 

I still didn't change the default for resampling_target, because I still think that setting ""labels"" or ""maps"" as a default will be harmful in most cases, because the voxel number in labels or maps images may be much higher than in images (in fMRI at least), and it will fill the memory very quickly. Imho, the safest choice would be to use fMRI images as target, but this option is still not implemented.
