This issue has not been resolved yet because the problem is not in adding shelving support in MultiNiftiMasker. This is the easy part. The question is: how do we handle shelved data in the rest of the library? What if a user wants to use a scikit-learn algorithm on shelved data? We have no answer for these questions. I think this should be discussed with the whole nilearn team.
