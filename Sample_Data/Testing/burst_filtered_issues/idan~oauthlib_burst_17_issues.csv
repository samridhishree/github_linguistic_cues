I've just not had time to set this up yet.

Regarding moving to RFC it certainly is time and I've only put it off because moving files around is boring and that OAuth 2 is split over so many more RFCs than just the core. For the sake of keeping with consistency we might want to split the draft25 folder into several RFC folders, Bearer, Core, MAC etc but not sure if that will just confuse things. 

@lepture Guess we could just start with draft25 -> rfc6749, is this something you would be interested in doing?
