You need to put it in the description of the PR (and IIRC you have to do it when you create the PR you can not edit the PR description later to add it).

The github [doc](https://github.com/blog/1506-closing-issues-via-pull-requests) about closing issue from PR and the list of [magical keywords](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) you can use.

14,issue_comment,798,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2015-10-21 12:24:29,"First of all, there is a problem that `nilearn.EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS` and `nilearn._utils.niimg_conversions.EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS` are two different variables, so setting one has no effect on the other. As an illustration:

``` python
from nilearn._utils import niimg_conversions
niimg_conversions.check_niimg('this_file_does_not_exist')  # error with please set global constants EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS to False

import nilearn
nilearn.EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS = False
niimg_conversions.check_niimg('this_file_does_not_exist')  # still the same error as previously
```

Also I am a bit confused about EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS functionality. Why don't we want to always use `EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS = True` ?
