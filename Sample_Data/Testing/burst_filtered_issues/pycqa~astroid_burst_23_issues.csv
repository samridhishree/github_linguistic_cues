You can read more about it at https://github.com/pypa/packaging/issues/72#issuecomment-232820331 to the end.
And `setup_requires` is not a solution that works reliably for older versions of setuptools either.

And setuptools downgrading to 1.1.6 on travis is not something I have seen before, and should be considered a bug somewhere else (not astroid).  It might be another case of #4194 (which I have only glanced at, so I might be off base there).

dependencies were not installed when installing astroid / pylint on other
releases, due to the Python version checks in the installation script. The
environment markers fixed this, so something was amiss there.
