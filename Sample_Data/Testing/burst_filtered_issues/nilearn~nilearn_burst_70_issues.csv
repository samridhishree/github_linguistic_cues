Any change on CSS needs to be validated thoroughly, as it affects the
whole documentation. These things are tricky.

Backporting some CSS from scipy-lectures to nilearn would probably fix
this, as a lot of effort went into designing a very good CSS for the code
block in scipy-lectures. But this is a certain amount of work.

Aggregating data, such as doing `sum` on all elements, is done faster than a test on each element. So, if we assume that most images will not have NaNs, this actually saves time.

+1 for copying only if there is no NaNs.
