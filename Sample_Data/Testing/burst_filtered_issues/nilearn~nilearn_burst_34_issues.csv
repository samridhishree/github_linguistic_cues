Proposed is a test to show that resample_img doesn't do what one would expect it to do when a 4D affine is given and no target shape specified. It keeps the old shape, leading to potentially a total loss of the relevant data from field of view.

Remedy to follow

- Add your name to the author list of the resampling.py file
- Investigate to see if you can use the np.pad function in the tests
- A couple of sentences of description of the example.
- Restyle the function definition of test_resampling_result_axis_permutation

Optional but desired: integrate the example in the user documentation: building_blocks/data_preparation.html#resampling

This is great work. Thanks a lot!

Describing the images I can definitely underline exactly what the function is supposed to do, but maybe the example is too simple: I chose mm space to be represented by `np.eye(4)`. The data are described by a different affine, from which I then transform to millimeter space using 3 different techniques. Can this cause a potential confusion between the target space of the transformation and millimeter space? This is my worry, but I am not entirely sure how to do this better.

Good point. How about np.pad?

As you whish. If it were not a test, I would say a docstring, but in
tests, docstrings are printed by nosetest, so they may be
counterproductive.
