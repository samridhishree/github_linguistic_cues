5,issue_comment,1144,nilearn,nilearn,alexsavio,2016-06-22 13:34:15,"In the issue #1135 I linked a small example where this happens.
In this example the files don't have exactly the same matrix shape, I was expecting a 'shape mismatch' error, but I guess you already added the resampling for plotting.

In my use case I want to plot a subset of the cuts that I get with find_cut_slices.
The thing is that I have it solved already with this PR.

Here goes the test:

``` python
import nilearn.plotting as niplot
import nilearn.image as niimg

img    = niimg.load_img('test.nii.gz')  # shape is (79,  95, 79)
bg_img = 'single_subj_T1_brain.nii.gz'  # shape is (91, 109, 91)

cuts = niplot.find_cut_slices(img, 
                              n_cuts=20,
                              direction='z')

p = niplot.plot_stat_map(img, 
                         display_mode='z', 
                         cut_coords=cuts[-8:],)
                         bg_img=bg_img)

niplot.show()

p.close()
