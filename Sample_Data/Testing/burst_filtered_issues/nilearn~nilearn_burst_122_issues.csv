1,issue_title,1516,nilearn,nilearn,jeromedockes,2017-09-28 12:05:23,"Hello @GaelVaroquaux , @mrahim , @agramfort, @juhuntenburg  and others,
 this is a PR about surface plotting.

nilearn has some awesome functions to plot surface data in
nilearn.plotting.surf_plotting. However, it doesn't offer a conversion from
volumetric to surface data.

It would be great to add a function to sample or project volumetric data on the
nodes of a cortical mesh; this would allow users to look at surface plots of
their 3d images (e.g. statistical maps).

In this PR we will try to add this to nilearn.

Most tools which offer this functionality (e.g. caret, freesurfer, pycortex)
usually propose several projection and sampling strategies, offering different
quality / speed tradeoffs. However, it seems to me that naive strategies are not
so far behind more elaborate ones - see for example [Operto, Grégory, et al.
""Projection of fMRI data onto the cortical surface using anatomically-informed
convolution kernels."" Neuroimage 39.1 (2008): 127-135].
For plotting and visualisation, the results of a simple strategy are probably
accurate enough for most users.

I therefore suggest to start by including a very simple and fast projection
scheme, and we can add more elaborate ones later if we want.
I'm just getting started but I think we can already start a discussion.

The proposed strategy is simply to draw a sample from a 3mm sphere around each
mesh node, and average the measures.

The image below illustrates that strategy: each red circle is a mesh node.
Samples are drawn from the blue crosses that are attached to it, and are inside
the image, and then averaged to compute the color inside the circle.
(This image is produced by the show_sampling.py example, which is only there to clarify
the strategy implemented in this PR and will be removed).

Note about performance: in order to choose the positions of the samples to draw
from a unit ball, for now, we cluster points drawn from a uniform distribution
on the ball and keep the centroids (we can think of something better). This
takes a few seconds and the results are cached with joblib for the time being,
but since it only needs to be done once, when we have decided how many samples
we want, the positions will be hardcoded once and for all (no computing, no
caching). with 100 samples per ball, projecting a stat map of the full brain
with 2mm voxels on an fsaverage hemisphere mesh takes around 60 ms.

It does seem small (although I think you want to argue that it is large :) ). If the projection were internally prepared and implemented as a sparse matrix multiplication (leading to no difference in functionality), then 

1. future developers, who may incidentally also be people close to the lab, might understand the linear nature of all these projections just by looking at the code they are working on

1.5 If atlas transformations for fsaverage atlases are incorporated, developers could create efficient projectors under the hood, because they understand that they are nothing other than a choice of linear projection.

2. these sparse matrices **could or could not** be exposed to the user. If exposing these matrices is considered a high maintenance cost because the change is outward-facing and will need to be handled with care, then don't expose it. Just let advanced enough users copy and paste the code use it at their own risk. That said, exposing these might add three lines and a docstring. The only downside is then being bound to maintaining these matrices (and who knows, maybe sparse matrices are slow compared to something more smart, but this can be tested)

“If nibabel is of older version we skip tests as nibabel does not  support intent argument and intent codes are not handled properly with  older versions”. That's why we don't see the failure in other envs which have nibabel>2.1.0
Given this, we can first try by generating a dummy surface mesh object using ```_generate_surf``` rather than testing with pial_left surface mesh object.
Second try is upto dicussion if we want to skip test.

sometimes a white matter surface, or something in between. If it's always pial
we can shift the interval inwards. We could also expose the shift as a

think we should still keep at least a small portion of it on the other side to
be more robust to small registration problems (this is what caret does).

because interpolation of data on a regular grid was introduced in 0.14. Before
that, the linear interpolation accepts a bunch of arbitrary points and computes
a delaunay triangulation, which is prohibitively slow - I waited 10 mn for the
2mm MNI template before giving up.
We could:
  - write our own linear interpolation, which would give us the opportunity to
    present it as a sparse matrix, with the same advantages we got from doing
    this for the nearest voxel interpolation.
  - issue a warning and fall back to nearest neighbour interpolation when the
    scipy version is < 0.14. Since the resulting images are almost identical
    (at least qualitatively, i.e. the plots will look the same), this seems
    reasonable to me.

need n points uniformly spread in the unit ball. How I do this now is by drawing
many samples from a uniform distribution over the unit ball, performing k-means
on these monte-carlo samples, and keeping the n centroids.

This is not great, so if you can think of a smarter way, let's change it.

Otherwise, these computed centroids need to be cached in some way: they are
independant of the image and the mesh, and take a little while to compute.
During development, I was using joblib, but I think we could compute the
centroid positions once and for all for a few values of n_samples, e.g. [20, 40,
80, 160], and ship these coordinates with the code, in csv files for example.

",,,switch 0 none default appear viabl approach 20171110 1003 gmt0100 kamalakerdadi notificationsgithubcom,N,2017-11-10 09:03:05
7,issue_comment,1537,nilearn,nilearn,KamalakerDadi,2017-11-10 09:03:05,"I don't want to open a new issue because it is already there regarding ```smoothing_fwhm=0```.

Particularly, I see this issue in canica and dict_learning when tests are failing because both estimator tests used ```smoothing_fwhm=0.```. See for failing of tests.
https://travis-ci.org/nilearn/nilearn/jobs/299711990#L3471

The problem is with SciPy 1.0.0, if I think I understood well:
This code produces an array containing nans with smoothing_fwhm=0.
```python
import numpy as np
from nilearn.image.image import _smooth_array

data = np.zeros((40, 41, 42))
data[20, 20, 20] = 1
affine = np.eye(4)
filtered = _smooth_array(data, affine, fwhm=0)

```
Internally the code uses ```scipy.ndimage.gaussian_filter1d```.
I see two options to fix this:
- To not accept ```smoothing_fwhm=0.``` rather advice users to specify as ```smoothing_fwhm=None```.
- If somebody argues that 0. is a scalar and acceptable input then we need to ask in SciPy tracker about anything I am missing with ```gaussian_filter1d``` before and after new release.
- You have any equivalent ```sigma``` value when ```fwhm=0``` ?

Please let me know your opinions as this some what important ?

You might want to set the screening_percentile to 100 to double check 
the behavior without the screening step.

Also, have you tried with a simpler (non-sparse) classifier, e.g. SVM ? 
If there is an issue in mask definition/corespondence, you should see it.
