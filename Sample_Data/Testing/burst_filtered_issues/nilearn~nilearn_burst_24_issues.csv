At least, renaming it `data-tooltip` has to be done, so we are HTML 5 compliant. At best, I think that we could use an existing unused tag like `title`.

This PR also provides a new (and simpler) way to fetch datasets. I was not happy with the try/except scheme. I had that by my side for some time, I think this was the occasion to bring it into nilearn. Now making a dataset fetching function is as simple as listing tarballs and the file they contain.

This PR addresses issue #123. Haxby stimuli are fetchable.
This PR addresses issue #68. Region labels are returned when loading Harvard Oxford atlas (labels are duplicated with a right / left part when symmetry_split is True. I am not sure if I had pick the corresponding side, I'd like somebody to double check it).
