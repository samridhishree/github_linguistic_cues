There are two possible explanations: either the normalizing does indeed improve the numerics, and the results are less orthogonal. I think that it would not be the end of the world given that the precision is still very good.

Or options: the norm of residuals is really related to the norm of what goes in. Relative errors are what it meaningful, not absolute. Thus, it is normal that it goes up.

Anyhow, I couldn't decide which one was true, and chose to move forward: I don't think that this is too bad.

So, 2 remarks:
- we should extend the condition to Spm*AnalyzeImage because they don't support int8 either
- when we use internal masks (90% of usecases if masks) we could rely on MincImage format since it supports bool. This would be easier than passing the data and affine separately in all the functions.

from nilearn import datasets
from nilearn.image import iter_img, index_img
from nilearn._utils.niimg_conversions import check_niimgs

haxby_dataset = datasets.fetch_haxby_simple()
func_img_1 = index_img(haxby_dataset.func, 0)

# This works
print list(check_niimgs([func_img_1], return_iterator=True))

# This incorrectly returns an empty iterator
print list(check_niimgs(iter_img([func_img_1]), return_iterator=True))

# This throws an error
try:
    print check_niimgs(iter_img([func_img_1]))
except Exception as e:
    print e.__class__
```

**Expected behavior:**
`check_niimgs` called on an iterator of 3D images to return all images.

**Current behavior:**
`check_niimgs` returns a list, or iterator, with the first image missing.  The output from the above:

```
[<nibabel.nifti1.Nifti1Image object at 0x10b3eaf10>]
[]
<type 'exceptions.StopIteration'>
```

**Notes:**
- I'm not sure what use-cases this would hit.  I expected `mean_img` to call `check_niimgs`, but it does not, nor am I clear when an iterator would be passed to `check_niimgs`.
- When `check_niimgs` runs, it grabs the first image to examine image information.  In the case of an iterator, however, it simply returns the remaining iterator (not a new one that contains the first image that's been popped off.
- I'm not sure the best way to fix this.  Issue #462 was an accidental product of me trying to find a solution to this issue.

The tests are not passing on scipy 0.9.0, which we must support as it is the standard version in one of the ubuntu distributions that we support.

The reason is trivial: the 'pivoting' argument to scipy.linalg.qr was added in version 0.10.1.

The solution is to test for the version of scipy, and use the 'pivoting' only if the version is greater. One example of such code to do this can be found on 
https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/blob/master/nilearn/decomposition/canica.py#L153

Thanks!
