5,issue_comment,996,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2016-02-19 11:53:57,"We would like the code to be really interchangeable between Harvard-Oxford and MSDL.

If you look at how Harvard-Oxford is used (for instance in the following example:
http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_signal_extraction.html ) we need the 'labels' field of the data bunch to be an array of labels.

Hence, I suggest putting in this field of the bunch, the ""labels"" field of the current structure, and a adding two other fields; one ""regions_coords"" that would be the current ""labels[['x', 'y', 'z']].tolist()"", and one ""network_name"" that would contain the ""networks"" field of the CSV.

As a results, the code should look much more similar for Harvard-Oxford and for MSDL.

Looking at the behavior on circle ci, to me the problem is more due to the refresh rate. The default behaviour (update the line each time a block 8192 bytes is downloaded) is too fast and circle CI cannot handle correctly the '\r'. There are other places where writing to `sys.stderr` is used and the problem doesn't happen because the time between 2 displays is long enough for circle ci output to handle the '\r' correctly.
Renaming `report_frequency` with `report_updates` would probably better reflect what this option actually does. Maybe we can use a higher fixed value (something like 100) and remove all CIRCLECI related code.

Well, we cannot rely on people having FS installed, so we would need to
provide downloaders, and for this we would need to check that there
exists URLs where we can download them.

I agree. Let's do this later.

Actually, that's probably a good idea. And that way we have edges going
to it in both plot (this needs to be documented in the docstrings of
add_marker and plot_connectome).

Actually do we want to make sure the examples run with the minimum matplotlib advertised version, namely 1.1.1? Off the top of my head 1.1.1 is the version in Ubuntu 12.04 so you shouldn't have the problems you mentioned.

Side-comment: the conda env should have libpng installed so the problem you are describing is a bit surprising. Having said that from time to time conda does miss some dependency (like the libgfortran case that we saw for numpy some time ago) so it could well be the case here as well.

You can find a numpy version compatible with matplotlib 1.1.1 inside conda. Just play locally with conda and you'll find one. I tried a few days ago and I am pretty sure numpy 1.6 worked.

Also, before doing that and now that it works, have you looked whether the running time of the examples has decreased, since that the prime motivation of this issue.
