1. Could the example be reworked to illustrate the difference (this is a matter of pedagogy) ?
2. Could the modules doctrings give some explanations on the definition of the distance functions involved
e.g d_g(A,B) = || log(B^{-1/2} A B^{-1/2})||
and of the resulting mean definition:
e.g.mean(A_1,..., A_n) = argmin_M sum_{i=1}^n d_g^2(M, A_i)
Good news: you can do that without using the terms 'embedding' and 'manifold'
3. Of course: do a pass on the necessary corrections, rebase on master etc.

The line is: `datasets.utils._fetch_files = file_mock  # overwrite the actual function`

The problem is that, in `func.py` for example, `_fetch_files` is already loaded. It should therefore be:
`datasets.func._fetch_files = file_mock  # overwrite the actual function`

My advice:
- split `test_datasets` in several files (`test_func.py`...)
- adapt the line for each module.

38,issue_comment,657,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-07-21 22:33:42,"> As a side note, we should investigate if we can improve the memory usage of the NiftiMasker.

We can't unless we change what the NiftiMasker does. The NiftiMasker, meant for one subject, implies that the subject data can fit in memory. By feeding multiple 3d files to it, it will concatenate them and mask them.

However, the MultiNiftiMasker is optimised for multi subject and will load them one by one. Therefore you should use it.

Your problem is : when the percentile il too high, all values of the image are kept, including the 0. in the background.
For me, the solution would be to consider the background to be masked by default, because it's background. And this is not specific to the percentile mode. I would remove the `1e-6` and add, just before the return statement:

need to be able to figure out that they have to click on the source tab.
The question is wether we want to show Mac or Windows by default. By
going to conferences like OHBM, I think that Mac by default is a good
choice.

@GaelVaroquaux @agramfort @bthirion  
### Integration within nilearn

I made a few design choices that should be discussed:
- I use a composition pattern over CanICA : this allows the code to be quite concise but leads to a loss of flexibility regarding initialization of the dictionary learning algorithm
- I use a flag `keep_data_mem` in MultiPCA to prevent us from loading several time (from files or from cache) the filtered and masked data. This make the code a bit more complicated, but I think this is the price to pay if we want to keep the NiftiMasker embedded within `decomposition` classes (which in itself may be discussed).
- [ ] Tests are needed
### Efficiency

This code is based on scikit-learn 0.16.1, though it should work on every scikit-learn release since dictionary learning has been introduced. With this version, coordinate descent for DL does not work (on read-only data), see https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4775. However, `cd` is faster once this issue is fixed (see attached file, so it should be used instead of `lars` whenever it becomes possible. Discussion with @ogrisel also leads to think that `cd` method could be made way faster.

Maps are held in the code matrix of the DL formulation. We therefore need to compute back the code after learning the dictionary online. Presently, most of the computation time is spent computing back the code after the dictionary learning part. A simple way to speed up results consist in reducing the dictionary with a RandomizedPCA after the dictionary learning part (RandomizedPCA reduce `lasso_cd` computation time, and has a lower computation cost - linear in data dimension, but with a smaller coefficient).

Two benchmarks can illustrate these points : version with RandomizedPCA is in blue, without in red. Output maps are almost not distinguishable. Reduction is quite experimental, but we can be sure that `cd` is better than `lars` in our context.

### Examples

I adapted the code from the CanICA example. I guess a more pertinent example would be to demonstrate DL effectiveness over ICA (which is the method that the community knows about). For this, we could rely on a scoring function embedded in MultiPCA, which should show better results for DL (explained variance ratio or reproducibility may be a good measure). I can provide the code for explained variance (should it be in another PR, or maybe in PR #630 ?)
#### Visualization

@KamalakerDadi It would be great if we could make use of PR #588 to demonstrate DL ability along with plotting power of nilearn.
### Cross validation

For the moment, we do not provide cross validation facilities for alpha. However, it should stay within the same range as the one provided in the example, as :
- Resolution in the direction of features does not vary a lot (from 1 to 10 I would say) from one dataset to another), which makes choice of alpha non critical
- Dictionary learning algorithm from scikit-learn is suppose to scale its regularization parameters so as to obtain similar sparsity for same input parameter. However, I think that regularization scaling is not made properly in scikit-learn (see https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4873 in function `_sparse_encode`, comments to come), so we cannot rely on this
### Online setting

This implementation is based on an online algorithm for dictionary leaning. However, that way we do this today is actually online in the direction of features (i.e. voxels in our case), due to the fact that we call `dict_learning_online` on the transposed dataset (we use MiniBatchDictionaryLearning but it is more logical to use MiniBatchSparsePCA).

This does not allow the use of `partial_fit` on batches of samples from a dataset (Nifti file after Nifti file for instance).

For large datasets (e.g. HCP), this is a big problem, as we have to load the whole dataset (1,5TB) in memory before starting the algorithm. @lesteve PR #613 has begun adressing the issue of large data analysis within nilearn, and it would therefore be logical to find a solution to this design issue.

One solution would therefore consists in changing the current paradigm in `scikit-learn`, so as to be able to learn the dictionary in an online setting. This is what is proposed in https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4873. I wrote nilearn code based on this PR, which could be introduced in the future.
#### Initialization

Initialization for such large data setting would then need to be studied (especially the sensitivy of the algorithm to this initialization). For example, we could try on doing an ICA on only a subset of the input data.
### Further development
- Group-level Dictionary learning

@AlexandreAbraham provided code for MSDL in PR #88, which could be considered for further development. This would be more involved, would yield better results but would be slower. Another direction to consider would be cohort-level brain mapping https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00841502, which may integrate more smoothly with scikit-learn API.
- Regularization methods

We use a l1 regularization on the code to enforce sparsity. New https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4873 sparse PCA used elastic-net ball constraint for this purpose. We could also consider ways to integrate better regularizations, such as TV @dohmatob.

The problem with this is that it forces to do things with the wrong
parallel-execution layout: you would have to load and mask all the data,
then do SVDs. Both in terms of parallel execution (imposing a barrier
between loading and SVDs) and in terms of memory usage (storing the data
in memory).

I tend to think that the basic element of reuse for stateless pipeline
operations is much more the function than the class. Indeed, objects are
not needed to keep state (the only reason that the Transformer is an
object is because it has separate fit and transform stages, and needs to
keep a state between the two). Functions lead to code reuse with less
boilerplate.

It is however imaginable that some such transformers may need spatial
information. I am thinking specifically about the feature screening
currently only used in SpaceNet but which in the future could very well
serve for other estimators as well. In this case it would need to be inside
the masker.

16,issue_comment,693,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-07-20 00:35:46,"As a general matter, I am not comfortable with the ""pipelining through inheritance"" pattern. Especially because it is not easy to combine it with out caching system.

What we have now in nilearn.decomposition.MultiPCA is:
- MultiPCA takes a MultiNiftiMasker as parameter (or directly a mask, this is not the point here)
- It masks data and runs a PCA on the masked data.
- Its associated function, session_pca, takes niimgs as parameter, calls filter_and_mask and runs the PCA afterward. We can easily cache the call to session_pca because most of the time niimgs are strings.
- However, if we want to add more steps to the pipeline (ie CanICA), we have to inherit from MultiPCA and thus we don't have access to intermediate data, the masked data in our case.

What is proposed in this PR:
- PCAMultiNiftiMasker inherits from MultiNiftiMasker
- MultiPCA is now almost empty, it is just a wrapper around PCAMultiNiftiMasker
- nothing has changed regarding session_pca function.

What I think is the way to go:
- SinglePCA is a transformer that takes masked data and returns their PCA.
- MultiPCA is a transformer. It has init parameters of both MultiNiftiMasker and SinglePCA. It creates instances of both of them and, on fit, streamline the process: it takes the niimgs as input, mask them in the MNMasker, gives the masked data to the SinglePCA and aggregates the results, doing a cca if asked. Obviously, this is run online and efficiently (njobs and stuff)
- This patterns allows the results of MultiNiftiMasker to be reused in further steps of the process if needed. It also does as little mixing as possible between methods.

Sidenote: is we think of it, the NiftiMasker is already a pipeline of operations (smooting, masking, cleaning). Re-designing it using my proposition would be equivalent to have a SmoothingTransformer, MaskingTransformer, CleaningTransformer and chaining them in a class called NiftiMasker (pretty much the actual code). Using the other pattern, we would have a function called cleaning that would call a function called masking that would call a function called smoothing. Unless you are competing for the prize of the biggest call stack size, this seems not like a good idea to me. This is why I intuitively came up with the other solution.

I am sorry to raise this kind of concern in your PR but, if we are to refactor the entire decomposition framework, I think we should do it well.

This is basically what is done with make_pca_masker : streamline is done within function `session_pca`, instead of setting up a explicit pipe between two transformers.

We never make pipelines out of transformers, we make pipelines by using the functions on which the transformers depend.

Current state:
- MultiNiftiMasker
  - `fit` calls `filter_and_mask`
- MultiPCA
  - `fit` calls `session_pca`
  - `session_pca` calls `filter_and_mask`
- CanICA
  - `fit` calls `MultiPCA.fit`
  - `fit` then does the work

Proposition:
- MultiNiftiMasker
  - `fit` calls `filter_and_mask`
- SinglePCA
  - `fit` calls`single_pca` that takes as input masked data and do a PCA
- MultiPCA
  - `fit` calls `session_pca`
  - `session_pca` chains `filter_and_mask` and `single_pca`
- CanICA
  - `fit` calls `canica`
  - `canica` calls `session_pca`, and then `single_pca` and does ica afterward.
  - Note : this is optional.
- DictLearning
  - `fit` calls `dict_learning`
  - `dict_learning` calls `filter_and_mask` can easily do the job if init is provided, and compute a CanICA while keeping masked_data in memory since everything is functional. Or it can call `canica` directly and use caching.

I see no need whatsoever for a PCAMultiNiftiMasker, this is over-engineering for me. But maybe I'm wrong.

Also, it is possible to chain transformers. We just need a `transform_iter` method that does no parallel computation but returns an iterator to treat subjects on the fly.

Well, no this is not the reason because the code behind the scenes is unchanged, this is only a refactoring the class organization where a part of MultiPCA becomes a class itself.

OK, it took me some time but now I get it. I'm not happy with `make_pca_masker` (I think that you could always use a PCAMultiNiftiMasker and decide to do the PCA or not inside) and I'm not happy with the naming, but I can live with that ;).

It would precisely need to be inside the masker, after the smoothing and before the cleaning. So, just where the masking is. This is precisely the code pattern I introduced in #665 and that allows to define NiftiMasker, NiftiLabelsMasker, or even NiftiUnivariateScreeningMasker if you want, using the same piece of code. Here, we are talking about software design for a PCA after masking. To summarize it, if masking and pca were 2 boxes, the actual choice is put the masking box inside the pca box. For me, it's not the best choice given that if you want to add another step, then you'll need a bigger box. I see that as boxes put next to each other.

But that's my personal bias, I am aware of that and I am totally opened to other solutions. I am just arguing a bit here because, in my head, I see a very simple schema and my impression here is that the spaghetti code has been replaced by lasagna code.
