We are trying to return the dataset asked by the user:
1. We are checking whether the dataset has already been downloaded in one of the dataset download folders. The possible download folders are listed [here](https://nilearn.github.io/developers/dataset_download.html#dataset-directory) in order of priority.
2. If the dataset hasn't been downloaded yet, we are going to download it in the first download folder we can write to.
3. If we weren't able to create a subdirectory in any of the possible download folders, we want to raise an error with a summary of why it failed in each of the folder we tried.

So I did not include the path in the error message. All the possible errors are treated equally(included in the log) and one does not need to worry about specific clauses for each error. Then at the end of the loop of tested directories, if none is usable to download the dataset the exception is raised with the summary of the error raised by each directory.

6,issue_comment,272,nilearn,nilearn,banilo,2014-10-31 07:26:44,"Thanks for your point.

Regarding the for-loop, the idea is not to _shorten_ code for iteration though series of niftis but to _unify_ it. This can have at least two advantages:
a) Increase readability: using a generator (at least internally) allows for identical for loop bodies regardless of whether one is dealing with a list of paths, a list of Nifti1Image instances in 3D or a 4D NiftImage - perhaps the most recurrent forms of series of niftis.
b) Centralize and further standardize nifti access: several aspects need/can/should be checked in a majority of situations: verify nifti properties by check_niimg(), does file exist, _get_shape instead of get_shape(), _safe_get_data instead of get_data(). These and other routine calls could be built into the generator object. This could help enforce good-practice usage and boil the for loops down to the essential operation.

Regarding memory, the possibility of processing niftis one-by-one can also be realized in an easier fashion, of course, is only present for lists of paths, and is a mere side effect.

7,issue_comment,272,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2014-10-31 07:57:36,"My problem here is that you try to solve a non-existent problem. `check_niimg` already handles all the cases you describe here:
a) `check_niimg` load any kind of image, whether it is a path, or a list of 3D nifti or a 4D nifti.
b) Nifti1Image has been chosen as the image type in nilearn. If you have an object that exposes another interface, then you have to write a decorator of handle this particular case in `check_niimg`.
