However, it's a very light modification and it makes the code work like the user expects it: asking the user to do fit(['fmri.nii']) is not good. In addition, the current error

In the long run, maybe we should think about this in the same time as when we do the globbiing.

I have made sure that strings are well handle (as per @AlexandreAbraham 's remark).
