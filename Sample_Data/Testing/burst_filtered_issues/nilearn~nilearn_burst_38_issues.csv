1,issue_title,192,nilearn,nilearn,VirgileFritsch,2014-04-29 09:32:50,"This PR introduces covariates fetching for the Localizer dataset.

Miscellaneous subject characteristics are available in two separate CSV files that can be downloaded on brainomics website (http://http://brainomics.cea.fr/localizer). They are now fetched together with images and put in the Bunch object that comes out of the downloader.

The covariates are not used yet in the examples, so there is no publicly-available use-case for it.

One caveat is that we need to ship the CSV files into the nilearn/tests/data directory in order to have the tests pass. Once again, this is a Nilearn issue that will be solved independently of this PR.

7,issue_comment,192,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2014-05-21 09:27:24,"> I can write/modify an example if you think it is better.

Ideally yes, and ideally in a way that's meaningful to an end user (at
least as much as possible).

Actually, it does so for a bad reason: it has not been centered, hence it competes with the intercept to fit the mean signal in the data...
If  you want to make this example meaningful, center the covariate and test it instead of testing the intercept.

Moreover, I think that there should be 2 examples instead of that one:
- one ""data example"", that shows how to use the localizer dataset, with simple methodology (classical t-test, no permutations)
- one ""methods example"", that compares permuted OLS with standard OLS. (and then other examples for RPBI, robust regression etc.)
