If we adopt the conventions that have been suggested to me, ""right button press"" should be called ""right button press (auditory and visual cue)"". Eventually, we would have ""right vs left button press"" renamed as ""right button press (auditory and visual cue) vs left button press (auditory and visual cue)"", which is very long.
Actually, ""calculation (auditory and visual cue) + sentence listening and reading vs button press"" IS very long and unreadable. Besides, it cannot hold on one line, which makes documentation difficult to write.

Therefore, I dare insisting on the fact that I would like to call ""calculation"" the current ""calculation (auditory and visual cue)"" contrast. This will for instance simplify ""calculation (auditory and visual cue) + sentence listening and reading vs button press"" into ""calculation + sentences vs button press"".
