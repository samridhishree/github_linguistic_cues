3,pull_request_title,157,nilearn,nilearn,VirgileFritsch,2014-01-30 15:44:03,"This PR provides massively univariate linear models estimation using OLS regression and permutation testing. The code is designed to complete a very large number of permutations (> 100000) on a large problem (thousands of targets variables, namely the brain voxels) within a few minutes. It uses parallel computing and an especially-designed data structure to store the numerous permutations scores.

An example is still needed and more tests may be welcomed.

Hum, usually we try to have as many keyword arguments as possible, which
means that we try to put default everywhere we can, but for arguments
where it is impossible to put a default we don't use a keyword argument.

definitions?
