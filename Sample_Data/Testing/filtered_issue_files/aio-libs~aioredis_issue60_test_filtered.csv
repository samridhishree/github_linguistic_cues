- First of all I tried to make it simplier -- asyncio_redis implements `asyncio.Protocol` (lots of code) vs aioredis uses `asyncio.StreamReader`/`StreamWriter` (no protocol code; just _read & send_);
- At the moment when I started aioredis asyncio-redis had no `hiredis` parser.
- asyncio_redis API forces end-user to work with one type of data, ie only bytes or only unicode or etc. So you would receive an error trying to mix data types, say `set('unicode_key', b'encoded_bytes_data')`.
- asyncio-redis has no way to execute raw command; aioredis provides `execute` method so you'll be able to use new redis commands before their shortcuts/API implemented by client lib. 
- ""automatic reconnections"", well, in asyncio-redis if the server has gone away would reconnect, reconnect and reconnect. I mean reconnection is done as soon as connection is lost which is bad. For instance we had functional tests infrastructure where we were starting & shutting down standalone redis server instance so after all tests we had several hundreds of spamy errored 'reconnect' messages.
- aioredis doesn't have pub/sub yet, but it is in progress and will be implemented soon.
