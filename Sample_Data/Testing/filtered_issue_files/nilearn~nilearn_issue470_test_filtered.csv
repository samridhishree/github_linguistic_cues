CanICA and MultiPCA require `imgs` to be passed to their `fit` functions.  However,
- `MultiPCA` lists `imgs` as an optional parameter.
- When either of these classes are created with an explicit `mask_img`, their `fit()` function raises a warning (despite users doing the right thing).

Fixes:
- Make `imgs` a required parameter.
- Call the downstream masker with `imgs`, only if it has no `mask_img`.
