The `verbosity` parameter should control output from a function, with `0` meaning no output (and a non-zero default for functions that we want to output by default.  In some functions, current behavior was to always output.

- ideally, it'd be good to have a teardown equivalent of this that sets back the datasets functions to their original selves, so that each test doesn't modify the global state. I am guessing that with the current version of the code, you only need one decorated test to silence all of them.

That would seem like the right thing to do to me. Unless the purpose is
to trigger the printing code in order to test it.

To test verbosity of any function, people should write specific unit tests.

What I've done is shorthand for that.  I could use the `inspect` function to recursively search modules for functions that accept a `verbose` parameter, and I could write a teardown function as well.

This seems the most complete and safest to me.  It could also wrap `stderr` / `stdout` to test whether any function has output... in fact, doing this for the entire test suite via a `TestRunner`, rather than using a decorator, is also an option.

pull_request_commit_comment,369,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2015-01-28 22:44:20,"tl; dr: it just seems to me that passing `verbose=0` into the needed functions is a lot simpler.

It does the job we want which is to reduce noise in the output of nosetests. Yes we may forget to set `verbose=0` occasionally when adding a new test, but we will probably notice eventually when either running the tests or looking at the travis-ci output.

Also as I mentioned above, it could be a way to potentially detect bugs, like the verbose parameters that aren't passed down the call stack. Let's be honest, I don't think we have so much time on our hands that we are going to unit test each of our print statements.

> To test the output directly, just don't add the decorator to the test

That's actually not true because you don't have a teardown method and you only need one decorated test with setup_silence to silence your dataset functions for all the tests that are going to run from then on. Changing the global state in tests is very very nasty.

An example of the side-effects, add this test at the end of test_datasets.py that checks that some printing on stdout actually occurs:

``` python

import sys
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def redirect_stdout(new_target):
    old_target, sys.stdout = sys.stdout, new_target # replace sys.stdout
    try:
        yield new_target # run some code with the replaced stdout
    finally:
        sys.stdout = old_target # restore to the previous value

def test_stdout_miyawaki2008():
    with redirect_stdout(open('/tmp/test', 'w')):
        datasets._get_dataset_dir('test', verbose=5)

    content = open('/tmp/test').read()
    assert_true('search paths' in content)

```

This won't pass with you current code but it will pass if you remove your setup_silence decorators (or have setup_silence be just a no-op)
