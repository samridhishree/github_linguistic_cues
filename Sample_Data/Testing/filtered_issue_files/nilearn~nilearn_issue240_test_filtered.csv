issue_comment,240,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2014-09-15 13:53:52,"It seems like the the tests are broken because confounds is None by default in MultiPCA.fit so you have problem where you try to iterate in https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux/nilearn/blob/better_pca/nilearn/decomposition/multi_pca.py#L276.

That was already noted in
https://github.com/GaelVaroquaux/nilearn/commit/8448c7a3e3851395d91eff10c493c1a36d581119

I guess you could do something like:

``` python
if confounds is None:
    confounds = [None] * len(niimgs)
```

The merge conflict is very easy to resolve, in case that's what you were asking for.

For completeness, here is the traceback of one of the failing tests:

@GaelVaroquaux, can you rebase your PR and/or fix the little problem we raised? If you have no time, just do the minimum and I will fix the rest. Apart from that problem, I tested your code and for me everything is fine.

I can also make you a PR or cherrypick the commits. But I'd like to avoid that because it would take more time.

Good point. It was a quick hack while I was working on a problem.

Sounds like a good solution. We need to work on this during the sprint.
