Not that I know of.

Nilearn is compatible with older versions than 2.0. We should probably make two codepaths depending on the version.

issue_comment,1095,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2016-05-03 14:30:25,"Thanks a lot for your PR!

Your fix is not compatible with previous matplotlib versions since `ax.get_axis_bgcolor()` is going to return `'k'` and not a rgba tuple. Maybe there is a more robust way to compare colours in matplotlib, not sure.

OK then using `to_rgba` on both sides of the `==` sign seems good enough. Can you do that @robbisg ?
