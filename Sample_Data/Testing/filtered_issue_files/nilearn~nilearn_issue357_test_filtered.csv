issue_title,357,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-01-20 01:41:51,"This is obviously known (see, for example, https://github.com/nilearn/nilearn/commit/e0f77613240be008a131da1a4a2908a6ea26713c), but not currently reflected in the `README.md` file (currently says: `Python >= 2.6`).  I suggest changing the documentation until this is fixed.

Here are the issues I've found so far; I figured it's useful to document, and I'm willing to start migrating code (and getting Travis to run tests for 2.6 and 3.4), if that's cool.

Python 2.6:
- Using string.format() with ""{}"" (`nilearn/version.py`, `nilearn/plotting/plot_glass_brain.py`)
- Using dictionary comprehensions (`nilearn/plotting/plot_glass_brain.py`)
- Using `try... except Exception, e` syntax
- Use of `nose` `assert_x` functions that are 2.7+ (see https://docs.python.org/2/library/unittest.html)
- `assert_raises` and `zipfile.ZipFile` are not context managers until 2.7+

Python 3+:
- Using `print ""string""` (vs. `print (""string"")`)
- Using `urllib` / `urllib2` (in dataset download logic & tests)
- Usage of `basestring` class (`nilearn/decomposition/multi_pca.py`)
- Improper absolute imports of nilearn packages used (`nilearn/decomposition/__init__.py`, `nilearn/_utils/niimg_conversions.py`)
- No `func_name` property available (`nilearn/_utils/cache_mixin.py`)
- Use of `xrange`
- Use of old-style octal literals (`0444` vs. `0o444`)

I hadn't realized that we didn't work under Python 2.6.

I agree that, as we are start to want more users, we should worry about
compatibility with, first 2.6, and then 3.3 and 3.4.

Here is the way that I suggest tackling this issue (thanks Ben for
stepping up): first (for Python 2.6), port the ideas in scikit-learn's
.travis.yml to have the tests running under 2.6, then get it running;
submit a PR. Once the PR is in, do the same for Python 3.0.

issue_comment,357,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2015-01-20 06:37:58,":+1: Sounds great, and am very close to having exactly that done :)

@GaelVaroquaux One question: `scikit-learn`'s `.travis.yml` file doesn't deal with `NEURODEBIAN`.  Can you let me know how you'd like to include testing `NEURODEBIAN`?  Perhaps just on Python 2.7?  Not too familiar with it, so no idea what might make sense.

issue_comment,357,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2015-01-20 08:23:15,"I reckon testing with NEURODEBIAN=1 only for Python 2.7 would be fine. 

I am not sure you can use NEURODEBIAN=1 to work with python2.6. According to [this](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/ci-environment/#CI-environment-OS), Travis boxes Linux distribution is based on Ubuntu 12.04 and Python 2.6 has been dropped from 12.04 according to this [link](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Python). Just saying I am not sure how Travis python version interacts with apt-get install python-numpy for example.

Maybe you have done that already but there is a way to set-up Travis so that it builds every time you are pushing into one of your branch, which is quite useful. Pandas developers page mentions this Travis [page](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/).

issue_comment,357,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2015-01-20 08:35:43,"Before I forget while you are touching .travis.yml, it'd be great to have the neurodebian specific stuff only executed when NEURODEBIAN=1. Right now getting the Neurodebian GPG key fails from time to time (sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver pgp.mit.edu 2649A5A9) and we are doing it whether we are using the Neurodebian repo or not.
