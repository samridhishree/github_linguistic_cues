Yes, we should. We need to use our code, unless we have a released 0.15
version of sklearn.

The right way to compare versions in Python is:

<pre>
import sklearn
from distutils.version import LooseVersion
if LooseVersion(sklearn.__version__) >= LooseVersion('0.15'):
    #...
</pre>

Unfortunately, this will be true for '0.15-git', which is the version
string of the git version of sklearn. Therefore we will need to
special-case it :(.

Now that I think of it, I find it weird that I should put efforts on code robustness in a case were it is not supposed to be robust.

Actually the main problem is not my efforts, but the fact that nilearn's code has been made more complex in order to handle a use case that does not match the rules. Then, we violate the rule that says that we should keep our code the clearest possible. The latter rule looks more important to me.

But all this are details I guess.

Hum, usually we try to have as many keyword arguments as possible, which
means that we try to put default everywhere we can, but for arguments
where it is impossible to put a default we don't use a keyword argument.

definitions?

But that's really a problem. Unless the data comes from a verified
source (eg the NIST statistical tables), what tells me I can trust it.

This is not a rhetoric question: in scipy people have worked in improving
the numerical stability of things like special functions. Tests like this
broke, but it was because the code was _more accurate_, not less
accurate.

We cannot just test against numbers that we don't know where they come
from and that we cannot reproduce. These are tests that will raise
problems in the long run.

seldom a good idea.

OK, but then you do not want to implement it this way: it is too fragile.
Suppose you have numerical instabilities in the random number generator,
you'll get different streams. One should never rely on the fact that a
random number generator gives you a constant stream for the validity of
an algorithm.

Solution: pass the permutation as an argument to your function, instead
of the seed.

If this is what you think, please immediately close this PR so we will stop trying to make quality code together.
You seem so attached to recognizing your favorite conventions, and so eager to find it in my code that it completely blurred your understanding of what my code was actually doing.
All I wish is to respect conventions the best I can and I am not responsible if you spend your day fighting people that do not have this wish. So please remind that we are working in the same direction.

I am trying to tell you that `random_seed` has been set up to control the state of a routine which is supposed to rely on random numbers, especially for the sake of debugging, testing, and examples generation.
Here, the algorithm _requires_ that we _always_ have the control of the random numbers because they should be the same in simultaneous calls to the routine that uses them. It is not something I do for my pleasure, it is permutation tests theory that states that the F-max correction implies all the targets are permuted in the exact same fashion to enable comparison between them (finding the max).

I can put `random_state=None` by default, but then I would immediately assign it a fixed value in the first function instruction (yielding a fake impression to the code reviewer).

So:

> why? [renaming `random_state` to `seed`]

To avoid conventional people --that recognize a familiar name-- think that I did not follow the conventions whereas I was actually doing something different.

> what is the gain?

It becomes a compulsory argument, so that nobody uses the code without controlling the seed, and avoid making the mistake which whould consist of permuting chunks differently.

The big picture of what the permuted_ols code would become:
1. `permuted_ols` has a `random_state` argument that is defaulted to `None`
2. `rng = check_random_state(random_state)`
3. `seed = rng.randint(sys.maxint)  # the common seed itself is random, or controlled by `random_state` in examples and tests`
4. parallel calls to `_permuted_ols_on_chunk(seed, ...)`  (all chunks have the same seed, they cannot have a different one)

Would still prefer to see `None` as the default and see the caller using a fixed parameter value upon the function call, since it is `permuted_ols` that is requiring the same argument to be passed over and over, not the function `_permuted_ols_on_chunk`.

pull_request_commit_comment,157,nilearn,nilearn,VirgileFritsch,2014-02-20 13:43:25,"@rphlypo As you can see, I improved the _f_score function.
But still, I think it now handles a case that is never used in the permuted OLS code, which is a case we will really need in the future (scipy, sklearn and statsmodels provide means to compute F-scores).
The code has twenty lines more, a lot more tests, and I think this is against the general philosophy of sklearn/nilearn to have minimal code/features.

The _f_score provided here, with the documentation about the assumptions, could be restricted to the normalized_design case and would only be a utility for the permuted_ols function.

I guess all this discussion is about subjective choice (except for the ""minimal code"" rule and @GaelVaroquaux 's famous ""you ain't going to need it"" ;). Anyway, we have it here now, we just need to decide whether or not we keep it or switch it back to the old version.
