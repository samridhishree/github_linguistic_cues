@sontek - If two legged auth isn't in the spec, I wonder if it might be worth it to start a project that uses OAuthlib as a foundation to provide it. In fact, that's the poorly stated (which is all my fault) purpose of the project. To be the foundation of other projects.

Google describes one use in https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth which is basically oauth without user authorization, which we do indeed support since it basically just omit the oauth token & token secret.

I've not looked into how open social do things but can see if I find some time this weekend.

Something like a base wsgi app or a small flask app utilizing oauthlib as a server would be great.

issue_comment,58,idan,oauthlib,ib-lundgren,2012-09-06 20:19:42,"OAuth is for authorization and not authentication. You should look into creating some unique identifier (which cant be forged by other mobile apps) and use SSL to your API. Authenticate using whichever method your research finds best (http basic auth is quite common).

You can never entirely trust a mobile app or any app not living in an environment outside of your control (ie in browser js app) which renders OAuth 1 pretty useless. OAuth 2 attempts to address the issue to some extent but not very successfully. 

When you want to open up your API for third party devs then come back and enjoy some OAuth. For documentation look at https://github.com/idan/oauthlib/blob/master/docs/server.rst or the flask extension you just found.

issue_comment,58,idan,oauthlib,sontek,2012-09-06 20:23:15,"I think OAuth can still serve the purpose of securing the request.  I plan on using it for my browser js requests as well.

Obviously having the private key in the website isn't _that_ secure but at least its going to be per app, per user key and verifies that the request coming in is fairly legit.

If I wasn't using two-legged oauth I would basically just re-invent the wheel and implement most of the features myself anyways.

What you might want to use instead is OAuth 2 Implicit Grant which will (if i find time) be in oauthlib in the not too distant future. To get an idea what it is without reading the spec have a look at https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2UserAgent which is using the implicit grant workflow under a different name.
