These test is failing because the docstring attribute of the mock ASTs for list and int are no longer tuples: 

``` python
            self.assertEqual(len(cls.getattr('__doc__')), 1, (cls, cls.getattr('__doc__')))
```

``` python
          self.assertEqual(len(inst.getattr('__doc__')), 1)
```

What I don't understand is why they were enclosed in tuples in the first place.  Maybe change this to a test to make sure it's a Const(str) node and call it a day?

Are they really tuples? When I ran the test, I get a list of Consts, which is actually correct, because getattr returns all the possible values.

Hmm, for some reason it was displaying as with parentheses rather than brackets in the REPL, so I thought it was a tuple, but checking the type shows it's a list, so it's working as expected.

ast_from_object was double-counting **doc** and so getattr was producing a length-2 list, fixed in 6da8294.
