Wrote cropping function into nilearn.image, which crops as close as possible along the axes of the volume array, and gives back a niimg with adjusted affine, data copied by default, but this can be switched off.

Does this look OK?

Just leave a 1-line padding. Sane defaults are good, and less options are
