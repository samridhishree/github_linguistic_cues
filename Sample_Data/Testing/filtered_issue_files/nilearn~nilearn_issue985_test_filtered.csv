Yes that is definitely an option. But, when negative levels are passed which means user knows exactly what he is doing. Otherwise, we warn or document separately about this keyword argument.

Well, I'm not sure about that.

This argument should have a doc anyway. But since we use a heuristic to autocomplete the input, we can decide which behavior we want.
",nan,nan,well Im sure thi argument doc anyway but sinc use heurist autocomplet input decid behavior want,N
issue_comment,985,nilearn,nilearn,bthirion,2016-02-09 21:56:37,"But then you have to rely on some heuristic to assume that e.g. positive 
values  for a encode the [a +\infty[, interval, while negative values 
would encode the ]-\infty, a] interval.
I think, I'd rather have levels=[a] to implictly [a +\infty], without 
adding further rules.
