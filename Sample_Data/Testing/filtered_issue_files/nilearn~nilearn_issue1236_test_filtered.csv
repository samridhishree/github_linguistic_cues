Sorry, but I didn't finish yet because I didn't have time to work on the statistical tests for the `tangent` kind.
I am not sure that student t-test is well suited to the vectors output of `tangent`, I think it will be a chisquare test. I want to work on that to be sure, and I don't have time right now.
Do you think it would be better if I remove the test part, address the other comments, and do another PR to add the tests when I am ready ?

issue_comment,1236,nilearn,nilearn,salma1601,2016-09-15 12:24:28,"> Quickly looking at your files, you already have tests included

I didn't mean testing the API, I meant statistical tests in the example, when I am using `scipy.stats.ttest_1samp` to extract significant connections.
We can do these statistical tests on the Z-Fisher transformed `correlation` or `partial correlation` coefficients, because there is some theory behind. But for the `tangent` kind the theory is not the same, and the statistical tests would _rather_ be `scipy.stats.chisquare`. I say _rather_ because you see I am not sure, and I need to look into this but I have no time for the moment.

In your paper I think the subject displacements are _assumed_ to follow a normal distribution. From what I understand, to  do the testing we need to have a Central Limit Theorem that proves the asymptotic normality. Actually such theorem exist for the `tangent` mean, but those theoretical papers point to chi square tests.

Sorry for not being more accurate, I really need to work on that and write things down to be sure ...

`vec_to_sym_matrix` is meant to be the reverse to `sym_matrix_to_vec`. So if you have discarded the diagonal in `sym_matrix_to_vec`, you need to provide it separately to reconstruct the symmetric matrix. For instance this can be useful for correlation matrices for which we know the diagonal is 1.

I have to correct the doc, but `p + 1` is correct here.
Your questions tell me my code is unclear and I have to rework it. May be I can add a little function that computes the shape of the symmetric matrix from the given vector, and also add a section example to illustrate how it works: if you enter a vector that does not include the diagonal in it, the computed shape from the equation is less than the true matrix shape

``` Python
sym = np.array([[1., .3, .1], [.3, 1., .5], [.1, .5, 1.]])
vec = sym_matrix_to_vec(sym, discard_diagonal=True)
# Recover the matrix shape

n_columns = int(p) + 1
