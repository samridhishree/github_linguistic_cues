as possible from the rst files.

I think that I'd like to move as much as possible out to a long tutorial
example, and reference that example. I think that the narrative parts of
the documentation should be as much as possible about high-level
concepts, and the code should be as much as possible in examples
referenced from the docs.

> And what is your opinion on the order of this part?

I am not sure that I love it :$. We can discuss that at a coffee break.
