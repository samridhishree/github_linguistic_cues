issue_title,1182,nilearn,nilearn,jeromedockes,2016-07-20 08:58:52,"This is based on PR #832 opened by @bcipolli in answer to issue
#640. The contribution is to add a fetcher for downloading selected

images from http://neurovault.org/. I have tried to address some of
the remarks that were made in the discussion about #832. I have
included the examples `plot_ica_neurovault.py` and
`plot_neurovault_meta_analysis.py` from the previous PR; they remain
almost identical.

The interface to the fetcher is similar to that proposed in #832. I
have kept the possibility to filter collections and images either with
a function or with a dictionary of `{field: desired_value}` pairs (or
both), but they are now separate arguments called respectively
`collection_filter` (`image_filter` for images) and `collection_terms`
(`image_terms` for images). Also, now the filters passed in a
dictionary are only inserted in the query URL if they are actually
available on the server (which is the case for the collection owner,
the collection DOI, and the collection name); otherwise they are
applied to the metadata once it has been downloaded.

For users who want a specific set of image or collection ids,
downloading all the Neurovault metadata and filtering on the ids is
inefficient; so they can use the `image_ids` or `collection_ids`
parameters to pass the lists of ids they want to download; in this
case any filter is ignored and the server is queried directly for the
required image and collection ids. Note: this is also done under the
hood if the collection id is used as a filter term - either by
specifying the collection 'id' field or the image 'collection_id'
field - except that in this case the other filters are still applied.

I have included a `ResultFilter` class and a bunch of special values
such as `NotNull` which can be used to specify filters more easily. In
some neurovault metadata jsons, some values are strings such as """",
""null"", ""None""... instead of actual `null`; these (more precisely
strings that match `($|n/?a$|none|null)` in a case-insensitive way)
are replaced by a true null value (`null` in the json, converted to
`None` when loaded in a python dict) upon download so that comparing
to `None` or testing for truth should yield the expected results.  In
particular `dict.get(field)` will give the same value wether the
original value was `null`, ""null"", ... , or plain missing.

This should make using `fetch_neurovault` somewhat easier. However,
for users who are interested in a large subset of the neurovault data
and are not too short on disk space, I would recommend using only very
simple filters (e.g. the defaults) when calling `fetch_neurovault` to
download (almost all) the data, and, once it is on disk, only access
it through `read_sql_query`, `local_database_connection` or
`local_database_cursor`. The metadata is stored in an sqlite database,
so instead of having to read the docstring for `fetch_neurovault`,
writing their own filters, etc., most users will probably prefer to
download it all and then simply use SQL syntax to select the subset
they're interested in. `read_sql_query` queries the database and
returns the result as an `OrderedDict` of columns (the default) or as
a list of rows. `local_database_connection` gives a connection to the
sqlite file, so that pandas users can load e.g., all the images'
metadata by typing:

```
images = pandas.read_sql_query(
     ""SELECT * FROM images"", neurovault.local_database_connection())
```

Of course if they prefer manipulating sqlite3 objects directly they
can use the connection given by `local_database_connection` or the
cursor given by `local_database_cursor`.

@bcipolli, @chrisfilo, @GaelVaroquaux, or anyone else, please let me

  - Images from a list of known bad images (found in PR #832).
  - Images that are not in MNI space.
  - Images for which the metadata field 'is_valid' is cleared.

It would be good. I have no love for the logging framework in Python, as
it is quite poor to give user information (such as progress), which is

Maybe we need an internal data-download function that downloads multiple

First it prints thing that are incomprehensible to the user (like the
module name and the warning type). That tends to clutter the display and
scare people. Second, indeed, it is not great for displaying progress.

Thank you for this feedback! Could you send me the detail of the commands you typed when you had this problem?

I tried to reproduce it but for me, it took a couple of seconds to load the metadata for all images on disk, and half a minute to check for new images and update metadata:

Load metadata for all images on disk:

```
>>> %time data = nv.fetch_neurovault(mode='offline', max_images=None, image_terms={})
CPU times: user 1.15 s, sys: 174 ms, total: 1.32 s
Wall time: 1.32 s
>>> len(data['images'])
13522
```

update metadata and download images not yet on disk(in this case I already had them all, so no new image was downloaded):

```
>>> %time data = nv.fetch_neurovault(mode='download_new', max_images=None, image_terms={})

More detailed info is displayed if the logging level is set to a lower value,

```
neurovault.set_logging_level(neurovault.logging.DEBUG)

I can make DEBUG the default logging level. I will add a `verbose` parameter in the function to control that as in the other nilearn functions.

The progress from `_chunk_report_` (the one with the 'seconds remaining' and the carriage return) is not displayed because the images have to be downloaded one by one and each takes around a second, so there wouldn't be much time to look at it anyway. If we want to have it, I can change the verbose parameter when calling `fetch_file` so that this report appears.

It will be more useful when we add a function that uses the new 'download_all' button from neurovault, but this hasn't been implemented yet.

Could you please provide the part of your script that loads the images? On my laptop it takes 7 seconds to load 7000 images and check metadata is up-to-date, using `mode='download_new'`. Maybe seeing what you did differently can help me find the performance bug in the new fetcher.

I'm not sure I have understood. by default logging output is dumped on stderr, so the user sees it on the console. Is the problem that log records will be printed on separate lines (and that we can't use carriage return as is done in `_chunk_report_`)?

The current behaviour is to use fetch_file to download each file and print how many images have been downloaded so far; what other information should we add?

I can set the formatter to print whatever we want; for now I have set it to print only the logging level  (but I agree it's not useful) and the message, I can change it to print only the message itself, or maybe also the time?

@bcipolli Sorry for the delay. This was indeed the behaviour, the motivation was this scenario:
- I download some images with a strict filter, which dowloads image 1 from collection 1 but filters out image 2 in collection 1
- later, I launch a download with a less restrictive filter, which would accept image 2. If the fetcher simply sees that we already have collection 1 and doesn't check that extra images are available by querying the server, collection_1/image_2 will be missing from the fetched images.

I have changed it to restore the faster behaviour you were expecting, so now it only checks for new collections. We could also try to update only the collections for which the number of images on disk is different from the number of images announced in the collection metadata

issue_comment,1182,nilearn,nilearn,bcipolli,2016-11-14 15:24:34,"@jeromedockes Cool, thanks for the clarification.

In the old code, Scenario 2 would actually still fetch the image, It would use the locally cached collection metadata to list out the needed images (including image2), and the fetcher would determine that it's not cached locally, and so go fetch it. This is because the collection metadata was complete; no filtering within the metadata itself was done before caching locally.

The scenario where the old behavior would not get a new image is if an image is added to a collection remotely, after the metadata has been cached locally. I figured, since speed is such a factor, that scenario could be taken care of with an `--update-metadata` flag, outside the default behavior.

Perhaps I'm just misunderstanding your scenario 2, and it's just the scenario I described. :) Either way, thank you! I'll try re-integrating this latest code into our project, so we can help QA it.

Yes, the neurosynth results are saved on disk, but in the same folder as the image they describe rather than a separate neurosynth directory. Here is an example output I get for five images (the first time, the neurosynth words had to be downloaded, and the second time, they were read from the disk)

issue_comment,1182,nilearn,nilearn,jeromedockes,2016-07-24 15:21:41,"> I wonder if it makes sense to limit the results only to collections
>  that have DOI value set. 

It may be interesting to consider only these collections, but it would mean ignoring a lot of data:
if we consider all images which match the other filters:

| filter | # collections | # images |
| --- | --- | --- |
| all | 276 | 6803 |
| with DOI only | 109 | 5000 |

Moreover, I'm not sure having a DOI is such a good criterion: Out of 191 (non-empty) collections which have a DOI, 82 don't contain any image which passes the other default filters.

> Excluding parcellations and atlases might also make sense by default.

I have changed from keeping only T, Z and F maps to excluding images when:
- 'map_type' is one of 'ROI/mask', 'anatomical', 'parcellation'
- 'image_type' is 'atlas'

Just to remind us of what the 'map_type' and 'image_type' are

| map_type | image_type | n_images |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | atlas | 18 |
| Chi squared map | statistic_map | 1 |
| F map | NIDM results statistic map | 2 |
| F map | statistic_map | 48 |
| P map (given null hypothesis) | statistic_map | 169 |
| ROI/mask | statistic_map | 286 |
| T map | NIDM results statistic map | 367 |
| T map | statistic_map | 1431 |
| Z map | NIDM results statistic map | 224 |
| Z map | statistic_map | 927 |
| anatomical | statistic_map | 22 |
| multivariate-beta map | statistic_map | 61 |
| other | statistic_map | 2822 |
| parcellation | statistic_map | 150 |
| univariate-beta map | statistic_map | 4288 |

> > Probably not by default, but we should make it really easy to perform
> > such selections.

For example, selecting only those with DOI can be done:

using `fetch_neurovault`:

```
>>> fetch_neurovault(collection_terms={'DOI': NotNull()})
```

using SQL:

```
>>> read_sql_query(""SELECT * FROM collections WHERE DOI IS NOT NULL"")
```
