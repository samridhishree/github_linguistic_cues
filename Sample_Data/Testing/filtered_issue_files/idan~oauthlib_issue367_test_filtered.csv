issue_comment,367,idan,oauthlib,devoto13,2015-07-27 15:10:48,"From the reason (pushes disabled) on the requests page it seems that Travis builds were [disabled in settings](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-core/blob/master/lib/travis/model/request/approval.rb). So probably the first step is to enable them.

Also found [this article](http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/triggering-builds/) on how to trigger builds though API. Related articles on how to [create Github token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/) and [exchange it to Travis token](http://docs.travis-ci.com/api/#with-a-github-token).

Managed to trigger build on one of my own repos using following:

```
$ curl -s -X POST \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -H ""Accept: application/json"" \
  -d '{""github_token"":""GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE""}' \
  https://api.travis-ci.org/auth/github

$ curl -s -X POST \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -H ""Accept: application/json"" \
  -H ""Travis-API-Version: 3"" \
  -H ""Authorization: token TOKEN_FROM_PREVIOUS_REQUEST_HERE"" \
  -d '{""request"":{""branch"":""master""}}' \
  https://api.travis-ci.org/repo/idan%2Foauthlib/requests

issue_comment,367,idan,oauthlib,masci,2015-07-27 21:04:54,"@devoto13 thanks for the info, very precious.
I've tried your method and it actually works, I can trigger builds on Travis.
The problem is even if I specify `tag`, `commit_id`, or just the branch name, like this:

```
curl -s -X POST \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -H ""Accept: application/json"" \
  -H ""Travis-API-Version: 3"" \
  -H ""Authorization: token xxx"" \
  -d '{""request"":{""commit_id"":""fecf37b""}}' \
  https://api.travis-ci.org/repo/idan%2Foauthlib/requests
```

 the build successfuly completes but with this message:
`Skipping a deployment with the pypi provider because this is not a tagged commit`
even if I swear `fecf37b` is a tagged commit.
Ideas?
",nan,nan,devoto13 thank info preciou ive tri method actual work I trigger build travi the problem even I specifi branch name like build successfuli complet messag even I swear tag commit idea,Y
issue_comment,367,idan,oauthlib,devoto13,2015-07-27 21:37:21,"@masci as from what I see in the previous builds, it seems you need to pass tag as branch name, e.g.:

```
curl -s -X POST \
  -H ""Content-Type: application/json"" \
  -H ""Accept: application/json"" \
  -H ""Travis-API-Version: 3"" \
  -H ""Authorization: token xxx"" \
  -d '{""request"":{""branch"":""1.0.1""}}' \

The only quick dirty solution I can imagine is to commit version bump, tag it as 1.0.2 and let Travis build it  in a usual way.
