issue_title,292,nilearn,nilearn,banilo,2014-11-24 08:53:19,"I have the impression that variable and function names tend to include a ""_data"" suffix when dealing with 3D/4D numpy arrays and an ""_img"" suffix when dealing with Nifti1Image instances. Yet, often one can also read ""_niimg"" in the code, which appears to conflict with the uniqueness of ""_img"". A little summary shows that ""_img"" is more consistently used than ""_niimg"":

```
git grep -ni ""_img"" | wc -l
1039
git grep -ni ""_niimg"" | wc -l
145
```

Thus, shouldn't we rename as many of the ""_niimg""'s as possible into ""_img""'s?

**Soft solution:** to rename the following functions and all calls to those:

```
- _utils.check_niimg
- _utils.check_niimgs
- _utils._repr_niimgs
- _utils.concat_niimgs
- input_data.base_masker.transform_single_niimgs
- input_data.base_masker.transform_niimgs
- tests.test_niimg_conversions
- tests.test_check_niimg
- tests.test_check_niimgs
- tests.test_repr_niimgs
- test.test_concat_niimgs
```

**Hard solution:** rename any ""_niimg"" string into ""_img"" in the entire code, thus including variables etc.

I agree with most of your analysis. In believe that in general, functions
and variable names should end with ""_img"". However, there is one thing
that we have in nilearn: we call 'niimage', and not 'img', or 'image' the
type ""NiftiImage-like, or string pointing to a nifti file"". Thus I
believe that check_niims, check_niimg, repr_niimgs should stay with
niimg, because they are about dealing with this specific type.

Aside from that, I would say that a PR is most welcome, as ideally we
want to address these issues before the beta release.

issue_comment,292,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2014-11-24 12:53:47,"Hmm, just trying to understand this subtle distinction in more details. What's exactly is different between _img and _niimg? Is the former an object which has get_data and get_affine whereas the latter can also be a filename and may have some NiftiImage specific properties.

Also, `nilearn.plotting.plot_img` is calling `check_niimg`so it accepts a NiftiImage-like object. Does that mean it should be called `plot_niimg` instead? This is probably not the only example as check_niimg(s) is used quite a bit.

Also just curious, do we have some code that only works with Nifti-images?

No, the goal is to have code that works with niimgs every where. I am
just thinking that for the check and repr, that are the basic engineering
to support this, I want to be explicit in the names, as these are the
functions that pretty much define what a niimg is.

exception, it accepts both paths and Nifti1Image objects.""

but this is the rule as far as I know the codebase.

To me the distinction is more about putting `_img` when we want to forget about/hide/render transparent the fact that niimgs can be a lot of things and putting `_niimg` when we need to be aware of this fact.

Niimg is jargon that has no meaning outside of nilearn. Thus I am -1 on
that.
