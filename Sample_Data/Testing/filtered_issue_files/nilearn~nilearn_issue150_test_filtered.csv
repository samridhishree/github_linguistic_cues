The tests assuming a recent sklearn version where scoring can be specified as string. However the documentation states that nilearn depends on `Scikit-learn >= 0.12.1`. 

Do you prefer reverting back to the deprecated sklearn `score_func` or rely on a more recent sklearn version?

This feature will work only with a recent scikit-learn. Given that
nilearn is not even yet released, we don't want to start doing backports
and hacks.

Travis works fine in master. The pull request breaks Travis by adding an
option that is unsupported in older version of scikit-learn. In master,
this option is purposely ignored, and a warning is raised telling the
user to update scikit-learn.
