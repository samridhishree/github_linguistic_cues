I don't mind having to force people to type ""subject=range(5)"" because
it's the kind of things that is not typed by deginers: beginers only
download one subject for example.

But, I don't think that I want to break backward compatibility, so we
should keep as a temporary solution n_subjects.

With regards to the examples, maybe some still need to be updated.

I think that you need to change the cut coordinate, to cut in a place where it makes more sense.
