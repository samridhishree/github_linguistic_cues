This is a possibility but I would be surprised as the maximum memory is set to 10000000 (10MB) and the size of the array is 12MB which is not that much.

Maybe using a strategy based on MemoryProfiler would help.

Indeed, under old versions of Python, there were segfaults when you asked
for too much memory.

But we don't use older versions of Python. This is why this seems strange to me.

Yes, I know how to do it with `memory_profiler`. The goal of this PR was to rely on the system and avoid a dependency.

Any function that is supposed to treat data iteratively such as `compute_multi_epi_mask` (or `multi_compute_epi_mask` or `compute_epi_multi_mask`).

You put a smaller object but didn't change the memory_limit. I would guess that's why the Travis tests are now failing.

I haven't double-checked the memory usage computation but it looks like the Travis failure is due to the fact that the memory usage doesn't go over the memory_limit threshold.

More than skip tests, you cannot import it at all windows, I suspect.
Which means that importing scikit-learn on windows would crash.

We need CI for Windows. I created an issue: #804.
