issue_title,1543,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2017-11-08 17:55:44,"nilearn.plotting.plot_matrix is a new matrix plotting function for matrices.

It is often interesting to reorder connectivity matrices to make blocks more apparent. One trick that works well is to perform a hierarchical clustering on the matrix and reorder with it (it's used a lot by the Oxford group, for instance in https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3690655/)

With the recent scipy versions, this is easily doable:
* applying scipy's average linkage clustering to the matrix
  https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.average.html#scipy.cluster.hierarchy.average
* using the reordering as follows:
  https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.cluster.hierarchy.optimal_leaf_ordering.html#scipy.cluster.hierarchy.optimal_leaf_ordering

We should add an option to plot_matrix that does it automatically for users, and applies the reordering to the labels.

Points to consider:

* Probably raise an error if there are no labels given, as then the reordering is not visible to the user, and hence a source of possible confusion
* Raise an comprehensible error if the scipy version is too old and the optimal_leaf_ordering function does not exists
* Should we expose the different linkage (single, complete, average)? We could have a ""reorder"" keyword argument, by default set to ""False"", and that could take as options (True, ""single_linkage"", ""complete_linkage"", ""average_linkage""). I tend to believe that average linkage should be the default, as it is often better behaved, but we should benchmark this on the data.",start issue,Add optional reordering of matrix to plot_matrix,nilearnplottingplotmatrix new matrix plot function matric It often interest reorder connect matric make block appar one trick work well perform hierarch cluster matrix reorder use lot oxford group instanc with recent scipi version easili doabl appli scipi averag linkag cluster matrix use reorder follow We add option plotmatrix automat user appli reorder label point consid probabl rais error label given reorder visibl user henc sourc possibl confus rais comprehens error scipi version old optimalleaford function exist should expos differ linkag singl complet averag We could reorder keyword argument default set fals could take option true singlelinkag completelinkag averagelinkag I tend believ averag linkag default often better behav benchmark data,N

Since there are already two differing opinions on the type of linkage, we should probably expose it as an option.
