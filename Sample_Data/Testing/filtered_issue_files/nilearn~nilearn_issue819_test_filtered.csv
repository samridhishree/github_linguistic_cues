The problem with this is that the failing tests come from a lot of places in the code and we'll end up with  a branch containing a rather big change.

Indeed: 

```

```

make checks fail but

```
random_state=rng.randint(1, high=np.iinfo(np.int32).max))

works and is basically the same as

```

``` python

There are two things in this bug:
- `np.dtype(int)` is `int32` under Windows and `int64` under Linux
- `np.random.random_integers` is inclusive for the upper bound (between 1 and upper_bound) and for some reason can not take np.iinfo(int).max as the upper bound (not sure why to be honest). np.random.randint is not inclusive for the upper bound (between 0 and upper_bound - 1) and can take np.iinfo(int).max as the upper bound.

Since multiple people will work on fixing these problems, merging them in one big PR seems like unnecessary work to me when we can merge them incrementally. I just try to save as much time as possible.
