This test was added in commit c2e8ca524793905018e0e4adc5e29e1d3b0446c6 to fix #172, but it's never been passing.

Rather than having all CI builds failing, I recommend removing this test so the CI can be of more use for future PRs. And then revisit the test to make sure the fix for #172 is working as expected.

Here's the failing commit to fix #172:
