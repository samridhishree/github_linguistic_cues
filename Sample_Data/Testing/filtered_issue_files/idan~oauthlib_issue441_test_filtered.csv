issue_title,441,idan,oauthlib,davidvartanian,2016-10-17 09:20:51,"Scopes are initialised as request.scopes = None in validate_authorization_request() method and response_type_handler.validate_authorization_request(request) is called immediately afterwards.
Now, in method _handler_for_request() called by validate_authorization_request() there's a call to if ""openid"" in request.scopes, which expects of course request.scopes to be an Iterable.

Since I couldn't find any other way this library to work, please merge it so that it's available to be installed via pip.
Thanks!
