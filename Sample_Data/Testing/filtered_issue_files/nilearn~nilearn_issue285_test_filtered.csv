1e-15 is for numerical instability. 1e-5 is because some algorithms do
not converge at a precision such that what should be 0 is actually 0, but
more 1e-5 think of it as xtol in an optimization framework).

In both of the cases I mentioned you just offset an activation threshold by an epsilon, except that the epsilon is not the same (1e-5 or 1e-15).

issue_comment,285,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2014-11-20 15:17:03,"I just realized that I did a mistake merging your PR. I am doing too many
things in parallel.

I think that the code was correct. The goal of this code is to say that
when you are thresholding at 1, the segment [-1, 1](ie 1 included) is
not displayed. The main usecase is to threshold a O, in which case, you
want to set transparent {0} and not the null ensemble.

If you agree with the reasonning above (in particular the usecase) could
please commit (directly into master) a commit that reverts your change
and explains the code better based on my explaination.

issue_comment,285,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2014-11-20 18:58:50,"I am not too sure about the use case, because in most cases I have seen, `np.ma.masked_inside(data, -threshold, threshold)` is used to mask the array and this function mask the values inclusively, so zero would be masked.

Note that this code is only used when using `threshold='auto'` in which case your auto threshold is the 80% percentile of np.abs(data).

The use case I thought the code was trying to solve is when you are unlucky enough that no voxel value is _strictly_ greater in absolute value than the auto threshold. I may be wrong about that obviously.

Now I think that it comes back to me (I wrote this code, but years ago; I
do remember that this detail was important) suppose that you have a
binary image, only zeros and 1. You don't want 1 to be masked, even if
there are more than 20% of 1. I think that this is the usecase that the
code was solving (I _think_).

OK. I think that you are right and I am wrong. Is it possible to write a
test for this or not (ie is the function structure right, or do we have a
tangle). If it's easy to do so, it would be great if you could write a
test. If it's not easy, just give up.
