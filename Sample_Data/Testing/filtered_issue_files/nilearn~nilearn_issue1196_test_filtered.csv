I am still a bit doubtful about the ""second threshold"" and all the magic it does. Do we have a reference about that somewhere?

The error is a bad idea: think of an automated pipeline with plotting:
you don't want it to crash because of the plotting when the image is
fully sparse.

Do they really? What's the definition of a point of interest? If people
want peak detections, than this function is not what they should be
using.

I think that where I've seen it used it to find where to put a marker in
the center of a region, eg in a plot_connectome. That's also a
visualization usecase, hence acceptable to be lenient with input, and
blurry with output.

Beside, it's in the plotting sub-module, so I would expect such a
behavior.

We cannot merge a PR removing this behavior. This behavior is important
eg in QC pipelines that use nilearn for quick visualization. We would
break their usage.
