No, it's definitely good policy. With this code it becomes much harder to
introspect or to pickle (pickle is pretty much based on reflexivity, and
this breaks reflexity)

From my understanding of Python scopes, you shouldn't be able to pickle the result of iter_img (the iterator itself) but I can be wrong.

I have no strong feeling. I just prefer classes outside of functions for the sake of readability. I honestly didn't think of people trying to pickle iterators.

Modal functions are not good for API. Users tend to get them wrong.

Aside from making the code simpler, I don't see a benefit of the greedy
loading.
