Are you sure that you don't mean the converse: vec_to_sym? It seems to me

I am not going to finish it before I am sure of how we do the statistical testing for the `tangent` coefficients. I am working on this right now, but I can in the meantime remove the statistical testing part, and address all the comments.
Just tell me if this is useful for you so I do it @AlexandreAbraham  @GaelVaroquaux .
