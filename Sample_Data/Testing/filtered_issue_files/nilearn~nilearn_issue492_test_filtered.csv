I can see that.

I scikit-learn, the way we have it set up, it adds a report to the PRs,
like travis, which is awesome. It would be great if someone could port
that to nilearn.

I think it should be set-up for nilearn too. It doesn't seem to be working very well for scikit-learn at the moment though https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/pull/4372#issuecomment-78054010 ...

From a little bit of reading it looks like:
1. the landscape report is done as a comment. When the same thing was enabled for coveralls, people were pretty annoyed by the automatic emails that ensued each time somebody pushed into a PR branch.
2. there is a landscape.io github [issue](https://github.com/landscapeio/landscape-issues/issues/108) about using the github status API which is far less intrusive but not sure how likely this is going to happen in the near future.
