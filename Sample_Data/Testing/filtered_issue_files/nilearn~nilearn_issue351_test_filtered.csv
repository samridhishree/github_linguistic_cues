really very good. It terms of long term maintenance, my gut feeling is to

I think having excellent download tools is going to be extremely important for the USA's BRAIN initiative (among others; it's the one I'm most familiar with) and the current push for data sharing.

I plan to post an issue to discuss later, but I think that the `nilearn` dataset functionality can be used as a starting point for something much bigger.  This is something I would be happy to work on, and I think I have some contacts that could help get some traction on it.  For this reason, I suggest keeping this kind of code in--I think it'll become more important over time.

With that said, it's such a simple snippet, I would only mention this once now and leave it to others to decide what's the right way to go!

I think that's the point: you never needed it so you never paid attention. But when you want to know (typically when you have a slow connection), having false information is very annoying. And this is not an edge case: when downloading a big dataset, I put my computer to sleep a lot (I do it 3 times a day: when commuting and when sleeping). Also, when I wanted to get my bandwith back temporary, I paused the process using Ctrl + Z, this also invalidate estimated time. Because of that, I ended up using wget instead of nilearn.
But I agree: this solution is not optimal (I thought that uptime was a standard module as it was installed on my box) and this is not the most important bug. Do we have a solution that can be coded fast and solve this problem ?

Maybe, but we are speculating on the future. Who knows how the resources
to maintain nilearn are going to evolve, and how the demand is going to
evolve. Right now, we are a small team, and I am afraid that the
complexity of the download code is starting to become disproportionate to
its usefulness. Importantly, the priority of nilearn is to be useful to
neuroimaging and we need to invest best our efforts to find the simplest
way to achieve this goal.
