I don't understand this, the auto-setting of the colormap would only happen when cmap is left to its default (i.e. None). If the cmap is specified then you left it unmodified.

Changing the colorbar a posteriori in `plot_stat_map` by interacting with the display object is thus impossible and raises an error.

Two possibilities for solving this:
- add `cbar_min`, `cbar_max` kwargs to `_plot_img_with_bg`, making colorbar range editing available to a wider number of functions (is this wanted at all?)
- do the saving by hand in `plot_stat_map` after the colorbar has been rendered.

Neither of the possibilities poses much of a problem. It is more a question of whether specifying `cbar_max` and `cbar_min` independently of `vmax, vmin` is generally useful or not.

I'd be in favor of this solution even if the colorbar tweaking is only used in plot_stat_map. In my mind _plot_img_with_bg is the generic helper function that user-facing functions call with different parameters.

An other option would be to add a callback that is called with the display as argument just before the save. Not sure which one is simpler.
