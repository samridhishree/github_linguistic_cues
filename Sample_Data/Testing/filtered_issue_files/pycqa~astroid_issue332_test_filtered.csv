issue_title,332,pycqa,astroid,sirde,2016-04-25 09:58:44,"IMO pylint shall check when assigning and when accessing an attribute if it is part of **slots**
Currently it only does when assigning. (see my question on SO)

I have edited the file python_dir\Lib\site-packages\pylint\checkers\classes.py by adding the command: self._check_in_slots(node) in visit attribute. It now checks correctly the access as well as the assignation.

I have no clue if it can have an impact somewhere else ;)
