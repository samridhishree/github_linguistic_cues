The only downside with a single figure is that it sometimes clashes with the way we use examples as step by step instructions. For example: [here](http://nilearn.github.io/building_blocks/manipulating_mr_images.html#smoothing) and [there](http://nilearn.github.io/building_blocks/manipulating_mr_images.html#selecting-features). Two plots were put on the same figure and it is slightly misleading.

I'd rather not. It's much easier to insert in the documentation in the
current state, and this example is mostly made for the narrative
documentation.

Looks like it, good catch. @banilo if you fix that, I'll merge this one.
