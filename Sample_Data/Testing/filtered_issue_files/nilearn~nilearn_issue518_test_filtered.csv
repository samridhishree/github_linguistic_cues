We have to:
- Fix the code
- Add more security check to rely on classical download if resuming fails without error

issue_comment,518,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-03-23 09:58:48,"OK, let's add details for the record.

For `fetch_craddock_2012` and `fetch_localizer_calculations`, resuming is not supported. But, instead of raising error 206 saying that they do not support it, they just resend the whole file. The problem is that, on our side, we are unaware of the original size of the file and just trust the server.

Luckily, server who support resuming add a ""Content-range"" header with the size already downloaded and the total size of the file. We now rely on that header.

A good thing would be to behave like browsers : pre-allocate the size of the file and keep track of total size and already downloaded file. But that would mean to create a metadata file and a layer of complexity over the fetcher so I won't do it.
