issue_comment,798,nilearn,nilearn,lesteve,2015-10-21 12:24:29,"First of all, there is a problem that `nilearn.EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS` and `nilearn._utils.niimg_conversions.EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS` are two different variables, so setting one has no effect on the other. As an illustration:

``` python
from nilearn._utils import niimg_conversions
niimg_conversions.check_niimg('this_file_does_not_exist')  # error with please set global constants EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS to False

import nilearn
nilearn.EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS = False
niimg_conversions.check_niimg('this_file_does_not_exist')  # still the same error as previously
```

Also I am a bit confused about EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS functionality. Why don't we want to always use `EXPAND_PATH_WILDCARDS = True` ? 

Is it because we worry about files which contains the following characters: `*`, `[` or `?` ?

Good point I missed that. Looking at your tests a little bit more I think we should be testing 3d data too.

If you only have test.nii which is a 3d image in the current working directory, you expect.

``` python
 # 3d image
check_niimg('test.nii')
 # 4d image with last dimension 1 i.e. it is equivalent to check_niimg(['test.nii'])
check_niimg('test*.nii')
