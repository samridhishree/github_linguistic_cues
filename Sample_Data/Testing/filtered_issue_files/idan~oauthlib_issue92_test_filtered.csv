While in the commit submitted the parameter switches off, it may be a wiser idea to leave the check as True so that backward compatibility with existing workarounds are not broken.

That said, implementations using this library should have tests of their own to check against overall correctness. Oh yes, they are supplied here, too.

I think verify_request needs to be broken up to match the three different use cases it currently serves, i.e. requests for request tokens, access tokens and protected resources. I've begun musing about this in #95 and hope to get to it soon.
