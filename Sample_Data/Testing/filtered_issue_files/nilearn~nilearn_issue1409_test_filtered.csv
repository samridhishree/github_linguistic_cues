In case of a 4D image, ndimage is going to take the large CC in all
direction, ie in the 4D space. That is most likely going to surprise the
user. I think that, if the input image is 4D, we want to either raise an
error, or loop on every 3D image.

For me (being more of a user): In my feeling no added functionality is needed as iter_image & concat_img should do the job already.
