I don't think there it too much of a risk of conflict between the two PRs. @eickenberg is changing plot_stat_map in img_plotting.py and aims at changing the cmap before doing the imshow. @banilo is changing stuff mostly in slicers.py and doesn't change the cmap before the imshow but only when the colorbar is displayed.

No. An converged algorithm (for l1 penalties) typically gives non-zero

sparse algorithms converge below that.

I kind of agree on this one. I think the grayed cmap logic has to handle this case.

> Similarly, I don't see immediately why negative thresholds are forbidden (maybe I'm missing some context here).

At the moment, the treshold logic is such that values in [-threshold, threshold] are masked so it doesn't make too much sense to have a negative threshold (full disclosure: currently it may well be the case that `threshold=-threshold` works exactly the same as `threshold=threshold` by accident)

I would say that we should definitely add this feature but that this should be done outside of this PR.
