The urlparse module in 2 was consolidated into the urllib module on Python 3.  I tried replacing urlparse with six.moves.urllib.urlparse.

``` python
result = test_utils.extract_node(""""""
import six

result = __(six.moves.urllib.parse.urlparse('gopher://'))
"""""")
```

This seems to work for now, but it's not exactly a clean test case, we should consider replacing it.

Why should it be replaced? If it works with this change, that's great, but we shouldn't change old regression tests, unless it's absolutely necessary.

According to the comments, this is for testing the case where a class inherits from both a namedtuple and another class.  However, that's sensitive to the underlying implementation of urllib, so it's not good for testing namedtuple.  We should manufacture a test that explicitly tests namedtuple multiple inheritance.  If we're worried about urllib breaking, we should move this test somewhere else, maybe to a collection of tests explicitly for testing the stdlib?  However, this has been broken ever since Python 3.0 and as far as I know no one's complained about it, which makes me think it's not an issue...

It's mostly about testing that we don't broke urllib and it makes sense to be moved somewhere else. Also, the test was disabled on Python 3, so it's not a surprise that it was broken on Python 3.0.

Changed in b68ee1186e5f.  This replaced urlparse with the appropriate six.moves module, but still depends on urllib's implementation.
