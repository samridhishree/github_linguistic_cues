Just wondering wheter there is a way to have some logic in the jinja2 template to say that if the .examples file exists include it otherwise don't bother. Seems slightly better than creating empty .examples files. By the way I am not sure about the ordering of  gen_gallery versus the 'autodoc-process-docstring' step. Imagine you start from a clean state, are all the .examples file created empty during the 'autodoc-process-docstring' and then gen_gallery comes along and generates non-empty .examples file or is it the other way around? I think what I am trying to say is that it does seem a bit fragile.

> Since naming convention for example references is to include the target dir, this references are also updated.

That makes the naming a bit too redundant: example_auto_examples_... Just wondering whether there is an easy but generic way to remove auto_examples from the reference name.

Also you need to rebase on master and fix the merge conflicts.

Sphinx gallery does its job first creating the .example files. 'autodoc-process-docstring' is executed afterwards everytime it finds the include directive to the example file

> That makes the naming a bit too redundant: example_auto_examples_

Yes, I agree on the redundancy. At some point I tested to rename it to sphx_glr_auto_example_ or to remove completely the example_ prefix, but I could not agree with myself on which to prefer so I left it that way. I support the fact to have the full target name on the reference starting from the sphinx source folder, so to our convention the gallery sits in auto_examples_. That way is was easier to link to the images and references. To put an additional prefix to it might not be necessary anymore, example_ was used because all paths where used taken the inside of the gallery folder as reference, so having the prefix became valuable. As a generic option I would rather remove example_ prefix than the first folder auto_example

I am not sure, it feels like the reference name should look more like the example python file than the generated rst in auto_examples. Also it'd be good to have some consistency between the generated image name and the reference name. At the moment the two of them have grown further apart.

> Sphinx gallery does its job first creating the .example files. 'autodoc-process-docstring' is executed afterwards everytime it finds the include directive to the example file

Surely this can't be true, 'autodoc-process-docstring' doesn't know anything about example files which are sphinxgallery specific. The only way this can work if the autodoc-process-string creates all example files as empty and then sphinxgallery comes along, parses the example scripts and overrides the .examples files. Just curious, is the ordering guaranteed ? Does it depend on the ordering of `extensions` in conf.py ?

More importantly, it seems that you haven't included the backreferences.py module in this PR (i.e. sphinxext/sphinxgallery/backreferences.py) is that on purpose?

For the consistency with image names I wanted to put it as prefix sphx_glr, then the path to the python example. That way is more consistent.

Yes the ordering is guaranteed. As each one is assigned a different event in the sphinx build. It does not depend in the ordering of the extensions in conf.py but to which build step it was assigned. Sphinx-gallery happens when the builder is started(outputs rst files, image files, .example files), but the autodoc file touch is when rst files are parsed.
So autodoc is completely independent of sphinx-gallery, it only tries to include a matching example file to every module it has to document. If it can't find the file a warning is issued, and in our case the missing file is touched and so no warning issued.

> More importantly, it seems that you haven't included the backreferences.py module in this PR (i.e. sphinxext/sphinxgallery/backreferences.py) is that on purpose?
