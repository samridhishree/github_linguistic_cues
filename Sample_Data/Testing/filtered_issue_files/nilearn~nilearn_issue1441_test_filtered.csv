May be we can catch this error and simply replace it by a warning ? For instance, I use ROIs contours on top of my stat map plot but I don't want it to break just because of this visualization issue. What do you think ?",start issue,could display.add_contours error when no contour found be replaced with warning ?,My code often break contour found default cut may catch error simpli replac warn for instanc I use roi contour top stat map plot I dont want break visual issu what think,N

You should see something like this if it could able to find mask (contour) to overlay.
