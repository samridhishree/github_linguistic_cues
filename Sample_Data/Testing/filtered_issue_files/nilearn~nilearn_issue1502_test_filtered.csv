issue_title,1502,nilearn,nilearn,PyTimGit,2017-08-25 07:21:15,"Dear all, 
I would like to extract all voxels contained in a mask using nilearn. In short, my code goes something like this: 
```python
from nilearn.image import load_img
from nilearn.image import new_img_like
from nilearn.input_data import NiftiMasker

#*get ROI infos from atlas
full_atlas = load_img(myAtlasFile).get_data() # getting data e.g. from AAL
my_roi = new_img_like(myAtlasFile, mask == 7001) # I would like to extract all voxels == 7001 which corresponds to the left Caudate in the AAL atlas) 

#*extract all voxels in the ROI
masker = NiftiMasker(mask_img=my_roi)
in_imgs = 'some_vbm_image.nii', 'yet_another_vbm_image.nii' # some imgs from which I would like to extract the ROI data
roi_data = masker.fit_transform(in_imgs)
```
I am worried now that the wrong voxels might be extracted as the in_imgs (my data) 
1. might have a different ORIENTATION (i.e. affine transformation)
2. a different grid space (i.e. VOXEL SIZE)
3. might be of different view types (e.g. LPS vs. RAS)

In principle, I would like to adjust the ROI-mask to the orientation, voxel size and view type etc. of the first input image. Is there any way to do this in Nilearn?

Thanks a lot once again!
Best,
Tim",start issue,Using nilearn atlases,dear I would like extract voxel contain mask use nilearn In short code goe someth like I worri wrong voxel might extract inimg data 1 might differ orient ie affin transform 2 differ grid space ie voxel size 3 might differ view type eg lp vs ra In principl I would like adjust roimask orient voxel size view type etc first input imag Is way nilearn thank lot best tim,N

you can set `target_shape` and `target_affine`   in `NiftiMasker` such that it will ensure having the same orientation, voxel size ...",nan,nan,Hi tim set ensur orient voxel size,N
issue_comment,1502,nilearn,nilearn,mrahim,2017-08-25 11:51:39,"The mask is resampled with a continuous interpolation.
I think you should first resample the mask with nearest interpolation : 
```python
my_roi = resample_img(my_roi, target_affine=img.affine, target_shape=img.shape, interpolation='nearest')
```",nan,nan,the mask resampl continu interpol I think first resampl mask nearest interpol,N
issue_comment,1502,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2017-08-25 07:46:36,"I am not sure that I understand your question. Nilearn will resample the
data on the grid of the mask. If you want to control the resampling grid
you can use nilearn.image.resample_img to resample the mask (beware to
use nearest-neighbor interpolation).
",nan,nan,I sure I understand question nilearn resampl data grid mask If want control resampl grid use nilearnimageresampleimg resampl mask bewar use nearestneighbor interpol,N
issue_comment,1502,nilearn,nilearn,PyTimGit,2017-08-25 10:15:21,"Thanks for your quick answers. Following your suggestions, I tried to use NiftiMasker's target_affine and target_shape to achieve the same orientation and voxel size: 
```python
in_imgs = 'some_vbm_image.nii', 'yet_another_vbm_image.nii' # some imgs from which I would like to extract the ROI data
img = load_img(in_imgs[0]) * I would like to transform the mask to the characteristics of the first input image
masker = NiftiMasker(mask_img=my_roi, target_affine=img.affine, target_shape=img.shape)
roi_data = masker.fit_transform(in_imgs)
```
However, this throws an error (below) stating that not all values are 0 or 1 eventhough np.unique(my_roi._data) clearly indicates (0, 1). 
Just to clarify my goal: I have an atlas of a certain voxel size and affine transform that is different from the voxel size and affine transform of my data. I would like to resample the atlas so that it matches my data (as this should be much faster than resampling all of my data). Am I missing something?

Thanks a lot for your help with this. It seems as if this should be a common problem when using atlas masks.
Cheers,
Tim
