In redis-py, why you could pass an optional argument to pool, is redis-py chose block queue as its pool's implement. The timeout argument actually is used to tell pool the queue had been empty for specific time. aioredis used deque as its pool's implement, so you can't pass a timeout.

Maybe you pointed in `socket_timeout` or `socket_keepalive` and so on ? I have added part of them into my project, and waiting for conclusion.

basically, the call to `ConnectionsPool._create_new_connection()` need to have some timeout
otherwise it will block the whole pool.",nan,nan,what I mean aioredi stuck time probabl long enough use pool basic call need timeout otherwis block whole pool,N
