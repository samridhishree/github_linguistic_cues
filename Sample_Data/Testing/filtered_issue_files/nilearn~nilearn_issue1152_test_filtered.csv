Problem: ATM, you need to import nilearn.plotting.cm for them to be registered. It would be nice to register them directly when nilearn is imported but that implies loading the whole plotting module, which is a but heavy.

What should we do?

issue_comment,1152,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2016-07-05 07:28:10,"@GaelVaroquaux @aabadie @lesteve @KamalakerDadi : Here are the three options:
- we register the colormaps when importing nilearn.plotting.cm
- we register the colormaps when importing nilearn, which implies always importing the plotting module
- we register the colormaps when importing nilearn, but we change the code so that the full plotting module is not imported.

Can I have your opinion?

Not really, I can embed this in a try ... except.

> I prefer first option.

I prefer too. If users push for something else, we will still be able to change it in the future. In that case, je PR is ready, I'll just add a test.
