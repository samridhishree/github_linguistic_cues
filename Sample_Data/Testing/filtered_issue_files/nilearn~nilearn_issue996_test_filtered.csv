issue_comment,996,nilearn,nilearn,GaelVaroquaux,2016-02-19 11:53:57,"We would like the code to be really interchangeable between Harvard-Oxford and MSDL.

If you look at how Harvard-Oxford is used (for instance in the following example:
http://nilearn.github.io/auto_examples/03_connectivity/plot_signal_extraction.html ) we need the 'labels' field of the data bunch to be an array of labels.

Hence, I suggest putting in this field of the bunch, the ""labels"" field of the current structure, and a adding two other fields; one ""regions_coords"" that would be the current ""labels[['x', 'y', 'z']].tolist()"", and one ""network_name"" that would contain the ""networks"" field of the CSV.

As a results, the code should look much more similar for Harvard-Oxford and for MSDL.

If np.savetxt does the trick, then let's use it.

However, I am really considering droping Py2.6
