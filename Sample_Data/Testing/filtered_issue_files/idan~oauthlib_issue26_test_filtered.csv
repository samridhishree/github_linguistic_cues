issue_title,26,idan,oauthlib,idan,2012-04-29 11:18:29,"Tests are nominally green, but apparently pycrypto's host is somewhat flaky. Some of the time, [the download of pycrypto times out, causing the build to fail](http://travis-ci.org/#!/idangazit/oauthlib/jobs/1202441).

If you look at the [build history](http://travis-ci.org/#!/idangazit/oauthlib/builds), this affects both 2.6 and 2.7, though usually not at the same time. Specifically, builds 29, 30, and 31 are broken only because of this issue.

Is there any way we can prevent this from happening, or minimize/mitigate its effects?
