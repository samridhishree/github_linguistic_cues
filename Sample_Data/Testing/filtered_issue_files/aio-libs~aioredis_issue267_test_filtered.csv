issue_comment,267,aio-libs,aioredis,popravich,2017-07-28 20:10:03,"Oh, there is no particular schedule.
Here is some tasks to complete the release:
* [ ] Documentation
  * [ ] Write migration notes.
  * [ ] Write Sentinel documentation.
  * [ ] Update Pool docstrings.
* [ ] Integration tests — write tests to check that new pool acts as before in old code.
* [ ] Link benchmarks (put somewhere in docs)
  * [ ] add network tests

Hopefully I'll manage to free some time for this.
