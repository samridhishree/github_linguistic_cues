I thought it was important to visualize the spheric ROIs. All the other maskers take an ROIs file while the `NiftiSpheresMasker` creates its own ROIs that are in fact hidden.
For me visualizing my ROIs is important, for instance if there is an overlap I want to see it, also the difference between different radii, etc.
Also, I though it may be useful to demo the `coord_transform` function.
