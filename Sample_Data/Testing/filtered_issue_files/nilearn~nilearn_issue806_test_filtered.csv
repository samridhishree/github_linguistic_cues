pull_request_commit_comment,806,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-11-16 09:38:36,"Several problems in your function:
- you have 2 `for` loops: one to fetch the files, one to load them. They can be merged.
- you have 3 for loops intricated for the 3 parameters. You can factorize that using itertools
- you generate a string for each item of the dataset. That mean that, if I want to have the matrices of dimensionality 20, I'll have to parse your string, which is inconvenient, you can use 3 lists instead.
- there is no reason to call `_fetch_files` several times since you only download one file

So I would write:

``` python
    dataset_name = 'Megatrawls'
    data_dir = _get_dataset_dir(dataset_name, data_dir=data_dir, verbose=verbose)
    description = _get_dataset_descr(dataset_name)

    mat_map = dict(correlation='Znet1.txt', partial_correlation='Znet2.txt')

        filepath = os.path.join('3T_Q1-Q6related468_MSMsulc_d%d_%s' % (dim, ts_map[tserie]), mat_map[mat])
        files.append((filepath, url, opts))

    # Fetch all files
    files = _fetch_files(data_dir, files, resume=resume, verbose=verbose)

    # Load them
    files = [csv_to_array(f) for f in files]

    # Build the output bunch
    return Bunch(

        dimensionality=dims,
        timeseries=tseries,
        matrices=mats,
        data=files)
```

A good thing can also be to replace the `data` element by `correlation` and `partial_correlation` or both when pertinent.

pull_request_commit_comment,806,nilearn,nilearn,AlexandreAbraham,2015-11-20 11:54:12,"You can take a look at the test for Harvard Oxford fetching in test_atlas.py. Before fetching, we create a dummy XML file otherwise the function crash:

``` python
    dummy = open(os.path.join(ho_dir, 'HarvardOxford-Cortical.xml'), 'w')
    dummy.write(""<?xml version='1.0' encoding='us-ascii'?> ""

The problem is that your dummy file must be loadable by `csv_to_array` and empty files are not. You can, for exemple, replace the call of `csv_to_array` by `np.gen_from_txt` directly. You can also determine the filepaths that will be loaded by the function and make them non empty:

``` python
    for dim in [25, 100, 200, 300]:
