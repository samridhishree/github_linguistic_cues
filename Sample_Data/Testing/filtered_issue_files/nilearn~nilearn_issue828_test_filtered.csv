I think this means that reading from file alter the precision. Note that the `mean_img` is a `np.memmap` object.

The values in `mean_img` computed line 236 and the one computed line 242 are the same. I checked that the precision was of 24 digits. The issues only happens with the last imgs test : the one with mixture of 4D and 3D images.

Yes, but not for this reason : the problem was related to tmp files that couldn't be removed in write_tmp_imgs.

I agree. I'm still investigating.

Yes it fails in any cases where a 4D is involved.

I had a hard time trying to understand what was the problem when computing the mean on 4D images being read from a file. I appears that the mean was computed on a memmap array as I already noticed, which could make the `np.mean` function return slightly different values.
I pushed another fix which consists in converting the memmap before passing it to `np.mean` using `np.ascontiguousarray`. This ensures the values are contiguous and the mean returns the exact same value.
Not sure the above is clear and also if this fix is ok.

+1.

But at least, your kludge confirms that it is numerical errors, and not
logic fault.
