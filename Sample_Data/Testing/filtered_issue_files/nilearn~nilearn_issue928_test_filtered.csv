Any change on CSS needs to be validated thoroughly, as it affects the
whole documentation. These things are tricky.

Backporting some CSS from scipy-lectures to nilearn would probably fix
this, as a lot of effort went into designing a very good CSS for the code
block in scipy-lectures. But this is a certain amount of work.

Make sense. I wonder if we can have multiple modes. It probably goes in
the direction of mocking the downloaders. @AlexandreAbraham might have an
idea on this.

I was thinking on a very high level: returning meaningful paths without
any download. The next step would even be to put some generated data in
these meaningful paths.
